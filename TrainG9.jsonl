A balance between sup expenditure is indispensable for maintaining good health. Despite its great diversity, food is classified according to its chemical composition into six proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, water, mineral salts and vitamins. Food performs functions in the body, 'building food' (proteins), energy food (carbohydrates and lip functional food (water, mineral salts and vitamins). Each type of organic food has a determined energy value expressed in kilojoules. \" Food Ration Food ration is the quantity of food that an individual must consume during 24 hours to c needs in matter and energy. Food ration varies according to age, sex, physiological state and climate. Furthermore, regular meals are necessary to maintain a balanced diet. Unbalanced Diet Insufficient food intake and a diet deficient in indispensable nutrients (malnutrition) le unbalanced diet. An unbalanced diet is the cause of nutritional diseases (Kwashiorkor), deficiency diseases (Rickets) or even disorders caused by an excess of food (obesity).

Born with the works of Mendel (1865 Genetics has achieved a lot of progress scientists since 1910. What are the experiments performed by Me do they lead to? acrosses of two different individuals of pure lines that differ by one, two or three traits (experiments of hybridization\" monohybrid cross, dihybrid cross and polyhybrid cross) manalysis of numerical results obtained using statistical methods. Paranta -- Gregor Mendel (1822- Father Gregor was a m F monastery of Brno Austria. He published in results of his experiments peas that he conducte years. Mendel planted 2 belonging to 34 different peas, made crosses betv Fa of different traits (color, and observed the results His studies led to the for One Hereditary Character Monohybrid Cross with Dominance Study of the Transmission of the fundamental laws that he published in 1866 a An experiment of a monohybrid cross Mendel studied the offspring resulting from the cross of two pure lines of peas that differ by one trait: the aspect of the seed (smooth seeds or wrinkled seeds). These two pure lines formed the parental generation or P generation. Mendel proceeded by making an artificial fertilization between the pistil of flowers of smooth pea plant with the pollen of flowers of wrinkled pea plant (a). The seeds that resulted from this cross were all smooth and formed the first generation or F1 generation. b Pea pod 136 2 Interpretation of Mendel's Experiments Glossa . Mendel considered that each of the traits \"smooth\" or \"Trait: what can be \"wrinkled\" seeds transmitted by the gametes, is determined by expressed in an indiv shape. In F1, all the seeds are identical (smooth). They have the same the sama trait and transm al their offspring external aspect as one of the parents. We say that they have the generations. If the trait wrinkled looks like having disappeared in F1 and hereditary traits and give then reappears in F2, this is because the offspring of F1 were hybrid variaty carrying it but it was 'masked' by the trait smooth. By convention, the factor or the gene that hereditary trait determines a dominant trait is symbolized by a capital letter (S \"Phenotype: set of characteristics that allows for smooth) and a small letter for the gene or the factor that an individual (smooth a determines the recessive trait (w for wrinkled). The probable outcome of the F2 generation resulting from of two different aspects trait self-fertilization (F1X F1) can be represented by a diagram \"Genotype: the geneti called a Punnett square where every individual of F1 gives the individual composod gametes S and w in equal numbers.

The results of the formulation of the laws of transmission characteristics. 1 Laws of Mendel In all Mendel's experiments of hybridization, Pes Traits the same results were always obtained: . An allele dominates another and the hybrids of F1 look like one of the parents. . The hybrids of the first generation are all identical (uniform). . The second generation, F2 exhibits many phenotypes. This heterogeneity or polymorphism is explained by the disjunction (separation) of the pair of alleles during gamete formation. . Gametes transmit only one of the two considered alleles. Stating the Laws 1st law- In case of dominance of on 2st law- Law of independent individual with a recessive p segregation (or disjunction) of the traits necessarily pure and of known g or factors This does not apply in case of The traits or factors of the hybrid F1 separate with a dominant phenotype and independently of one another during gamete genotype.

This transmission abides by certain statistical laws established by Mendel a experiments of hybridization that he performed on pea plants. These laws are: 1st law: Law of uniformity of hybrids of the first generation F1 2nd law: Law of independent segregation of traits or factors 3rd law: Law of purity of gametes The first generation of hybrids is homogeneous, this means that all hybrids posse phenotype and the same genotype for a certain trait. A phenotype is all the obsen an individual and the genotype is all the genes responsible for this phenotype. If the hybrids exhibit the same phenotype as one of the parents, this means that th parent is dominant, and the trait of the second parent is recessive. If the hybrid intermediate phenotype between the two parents, it is then a case of incomplete d Hereditary factors or genes determine hereditary traits. A gene is presented in diffe alleles. When the two alleles are identical for a certain trait, the individual is homoz two alleles are different, the individual is heterozygous.

Thousands of them are for hereditary disorders. The same gene is located in the same place on the two homologous chromosomes carry identical or different information of the same trait. A gene is present in the cell of an individual in two versions or alleles. These alleles same place on each of the two chromosomes of the same pair. If the two alleles are the hereditary trait is expressed in the individual for this version of the gene. If the tw are different, the one that is dominant determines alone the trait of the individual. The allele is recessive and is not expressed.

Amniocentesis is a technique of prenatal testing that consists in taking a small amount of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus and analyzing it. . Fetal cells in the amniotic fluid are used to make a karyotype which can then be analyzed. This involves an examination of the chromosomes found in these cells to look for any abnormalities. Amniocentesis is practiced in week 17th of pregnancy. It is mainly done when parents already have a child with a chromosomal abnormality or when the mother is over the age of 38.

He received the that there was an integral number of electrons Z, whose charge was Noble Prize in Physics in exactly balanced by the jelly-like positive charge, making the atom 1906 electrically neutral. In 1911, Rutherford devised an experiment to test Thomson's model. In his experiment he used positively charged alpha particles 18 Veit One: The Anne to shoot at a very thin layer of atoms in gold foil. Most of the particles went through the foil with little or no change of direction. A few, however, bounced off the foil at sharp angles. This was a totally unexpected result, inconsistent with Thomson's atomic model, because most alpha particles passed through the gold atoms unaffected.

Radioisotopes are very useful in medicine. They are helpful in diagnosing cancer. They are also used to treat cancer with radiation therapy. In the diagnosis of internal disorders, physicians need information on the locations of disorders. This is done by imaging, a technique in which the radioisotope, either alone or combined with some other chemical, accumulates at the site of the disorder. There, the radioactive isotope disintegrates and emits its characteristic radiation, which is detected.

The Periodic Table During the 19\" century, chemists have made many useful studies of the properties of the elements. Their effort was to arrange the elements in a table by matching similar properties between any two elements. Mendeleev's Periodic Table Glossary In 1869, Mendeleev arranged the elements in the order of increasing Periodicity: is the atomic mass. Based on experiments, Mendeleev observed tendency to recur at periodicity in the properties of the elements. He placed the elements regular intervals. in vertical columns and horizontal rows. In today's modern periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number. The modern periodic table consists of 18 vertical columns (groups) and 7 horizontal rows (periods). 14 Atomic m -Chemical of the elen Fig. 33 Henry Moseley (1887- 1 1915) contributed to the development of the periodic 1 H 2 tubile.

An aurora borealis is attributed to charged particles, electrons and protons, emitted from the sun and other stars. These high energy, electrically charged particles are trapped by the earth's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere. There the particles collide with oxygen and nitrogen molecules and transfer energy to them. The energy causes electrons in these atoms and molecules to jump to higher energy levels. When the electrons return to lower energy levels, they release the absorbed energy as light. When the frequency of radiant energy released by the molecules or atoms is in the visible range, they can be seen as an aurora. The Aurora borealis is caused by solar wind \"cosmic rays\" following the magnetic field lines toward the North pole. Science and Society Some Uses for Noble gases Lighting tubes are generally filled with a noble gas such as neon or argon. So, while the electrically heated filaments that produce the light get hot, the surrounding noble gases do not react with the hot filament. If heated in air, the elements that constitute the filament would soon burn up. 42 tain One: The Abe Fig. 37 The various colors of light emitted by Neon-type signs are due to different noble gases. Noble gases may be used when it is necessary to have a substance that is unreactive, Scuba divers normally use a pressurized mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gases for breathing under water. However, when the air mixture is used at depths where pressure is high, the nitrogen gas is absorbed into the blood, where it can cause mental disorientation. To avoid this problem, a breathing mixture of oxygen and helium may be substituted. The diver still obtains the necessary oxygen, but the unreactive helium that dissolves in the blood does not cause mental disorientation. However, its lower density does change the vibrations of the vocal cords, and the diver will sound like Donald Duck. A gaseous solution oxygen-helium is used in scuba tanks. Helium is also used to fill blimps and balloons. When dirigibles were first designed, they were filled with hydrogen, a very light gas. However, when they are in contact with any type of spark or heating source, they explode violently because of the extreme reactivity of hydrogen gas with oxygen present in the air. Today, blimps are filled with unreactive helium gas, Fig. Helium is used to fill which presents no danger of explosion.

Limit For, Orpatic O Fig. A carbon atom typically forms four covalent bonds 2.3 Structural Formula The molecular formula of a compound shows the actual number of atoms of each element making up that molecule. For example, water H,O, methane CH ,, glucose C,H __ O ,.... etc. The structural formula of a compound shows the different atoms in a molecule that are connected to each other by means of covalent bonds. For example, the molecular formula of the simplest hydrocarbon, methane CH4, does not show the bonds between the carbon and the 4 hydrogen atoms. However, in the Lewis dot structure (electron-dot formula), each pair of electrons represents a single bond, which shows that a carbon atom is connected to 4 hydrogen atoms. In methane, the four hydrogen atoms form the corners of a regular tetrahedron. However, it is more convenient to use the flat H representation for writing (drawing) the structural formula of methane molecule.

In writing the structural formula for ethane, ethene and ethyne, C - H bond is shown as a single line. In fact pattern holds true in a series of hydrocarbons where all the c atoms of a molecule are only connected to each other th (C - C) single bonds. The class (family hydrocarbons that have the general formula C,H2 ... is callo alkane series or alkane family. The ethene molecule, previously built, has 2 hydrogen atom than the corresponding alkane (ethane and ethene have the number of carbon atoms per molecule). Thus, the numb hydrogen atoms is twice the number of carbon atoms. Therefo the number of carbon atoms is (n), the number of hydrogen ato (2n). The class of hydrocarbons that have the general formula is called the alkene family. An alkene molecule contains one (C double bond. Because, the ethyne molecule, previously built, is obtaine removing 4 hydrogen atoms from the ethane molecule (2 hyd atoms from ethene molecule). Therefore, by analogy, the cla hydrocarbons that have the formula C_H3 , is called the a series or alkyne family. An alkyne molecule contains one (C triple bond. 96 3.2 Saturated and Unsaturated Hydrocarbons Alkanes are said to be saturated. because each carbon atom holds the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that it can hold. Alkenes and alkynes containing double and triple bonds are unsaturated. It is possible to add molecular hydrogen to an alkene-until it can take up no more - to saturate it with hydrogen. A molecule of hydrocarbon to which we cannot add any hydrogen is considered to be saturated. The conversion of ethene (an unsaturated hydrocarbon) to ethane (a saturated hydrocarbon) can be represented by Lewis dot structure as follows: H C :: C .

The alkanes obtained as such are called straight-chain alkanes or normal alkanes. For example, the continuous straight-chain of carbon atoms in the alkane C.H10 can be represented as: C-C-C-C C-C-C C-C C-C c-c In a straight-chain alkane, no carbon atom is bonded to more than two carbon atoms.

The two alkyl groups R and R, can be the same or can be different. In a molecule of branched-chain alkane not all carbon atoms of the molecule are connected in a continuous straight-chain. 4.4.2 Cycloalkanes Carbon atoms can be joined to each other in rings, giving rise to a series of saturated hydrocarbons called cycloalkancs. The names of cycloalkanes are derived from the names of straight- chain alkanes by placing the prefix cyclo in front of the name of the alkane that has the same number of carbon atoms. Cycloalkanes have the general formula C,H2 ,- Upon adding bromine solution to a cycloalkane, the orange color of bromine solution does not change, indicating that there is no reaction.

To find IUPAC name of an alkane, the following rules are fol 1. Alkanes without branches (straight-chain) are named accor the number of the carbon atoms. These names, up to ten atoms, are given on page 101 table 4.3 2. The names of branched-chain alkanes are made up of two substituted alkyl groups main chain first part second part - The name of the second part is taken from the longest cont chain of carbon atoms (also called main chain). - The first part of the name consists of prefixes that indicat groups connected to the main chain. For example, suppose the following branched-chain alkane ( be named: 104 The rules to be followed are: i - Locate the main chain: CH CH, CH, - CH - CH2 - CH, CH3 - CH - CH2 - CH, The main chain contains four carbon atoms. The second part of the name would be butane. (The compound would be named as a derivative of butane). ii - Identify the alkyl group(s) connected to the main chain. In this example, the alkyl group is (CH ,- ), methyl. iii - Show the location of the connected alkyl group ( or groups) by assigning numbers to the carbon atoms of the main chain. The main chain is numbered in such a way that the first alkyl group (branch) encountered along the chain receives the lowest possible number. CH CH, (D) CH3 - CH - CH2 - CH, (ID) CH, - CH - CH2-CH, correct numbering 1 2 3 4 2 3 4 of main chain - incorrect numbering 4 3 2 of main chain The systematic name of the branched-alkane (A) is 2-methylbutane. Now, suppose the branched-chain alkane (B) is to be named: Rema Alkane (B): IUPAC names for hydrocarbons are v CH, one word. CH1 -C.

Naming of Haloalkanes (alkyl halides) When a hydrogen atom of the main chain of an alkane is replaced by a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine, the ending -ine of the element is changed to - o. The compound is called a haloalkane (alkyl halide). The prefix for halogen atom is \"halo\" for example: fluoro chloro for - Cl, bromo for - Br , and all the above mentione are applicable in this case, too. For example, supp halosubstituted alkane has the structural formula : HHH H-C-C-C-H its name is 2-chloropropane. The word isomer comes from the Greek roots: Iso -, meaning same, and 4.5.2 Structural isomers mer -, meaning part. Compounds that have the same molecular formula but d arrangements (connectivities) of their atoms are called str isomers. The molecular formula of butane is C_H10, its structural form be represented as (1) or (II). In structure II instead of having four carbon atoms connc a) butone continuous chain, it has a continuous chain of only three atoms. The fourth carbon atom is branched off the middle ca the three-carbon chain. The isomeric butanes, butane and 2-methylpropane, are str isomers.

Commercial Uses of Substitution Products of Methane HALOMETHANES Halomethanes are compounds derived from the reaction of methane with halogens like fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Because of their properties, many halomethanes have found wide commercial use. These include application as commercial solvents, refrigerants, dry-cleaning agents, local and inhalation anesthetics, and insecticides, A halomethane molecule may contain one or more atoms of the same or different halogens. For example, dichloromethane CH,CI, is used as a solvent to extract perfumes, nicotin, caffeine, quinine, ... Chloroform CHCI, a colorless dense sweet smelling liquid, is used as anesthetic and solvent. Carbon tetrachloride, CCL, a colorless, dense and non flammable liquid immiscible with water, is a good solvent for oil and grease and at one time found wide use in dry-cleaning industry. It is somewhat toxic and like all organic solvents should be used only with adequate ventillation. Bromochlorodifluoromethane BrCIF,C is used as a fire extinguisher. a-iodoethane Dichlorodifluoromethane CI,F;C (CFC) which is marketed under the trade name Freon-12 is used in refrigeration, air conditioning systems, aerosols and as solvents. Freons are stable compounds which are difficult to destroy. They are a major source of pollution and cause serious environmental problems. They cause a depletion of the valuable ozone in Earth's b- bromoethane upper atmosphere (stratosphere). At the present time, companies are trying to produce and use freons in limited amounts and replace CFCs by other halogenated compounds that are not as damaging to the atmosphere.

Natural gas sometimes occurs in underground pocket but it is usually found associated with petroleum deposits. 136 Natural gas can be pumped easily through pipelines and is used mostly as fuel, but it also serves as a raw material for making many organic compounds. 1.3 Petroleum Petroleum (crude oil) is a viscous liquid composed of many different hydrocarbons the majority of which are open-chain and cyclic alkanes, and must be processed before it is used. From the well, petroleum is transported in tankers or pipelines to a refinery where it is processed. Petroleum once processed is used as a major energy source.

These different boiling points are roughly related to the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbons. (Table 3.1) Chaper HI1: Pytmoins and Synthetic Materiais Table 3.1 The constituents and uses of the different fractions from petroleum. Separation of the hydrocarbons takes place inside a fr tower (fractionating distillation column) where many pla provide multiple surfaces on which repeated condensation cycles take place. This method of separati fractional distillation refinery gas used as a fuel gasoline used as fuel in cars Remark Viscous liquid: naphtha used to make A liquid which is thick , FRACTIONATING chemicals gluey and does not pour TOWER very easily. 58 Fractional distillation of petroleum in refinery. As it boils the vapor passes up to the tower. The temperature of the tower is controlled so that it is hotter at the bottom and cooler at the top. Because the boiling point increases as the number of carbon atoms increases in the molecule, the heavier (higher-boiling) components condense near the bottom. The lighter (lower-boiling) components condense at the different levels (heights) of the tower. These components are called fractions; they are collected in trays. The individual hydrocarbons of each fraction can then be obtained by further fractional distillation. 1.5 Cracking Cracking uses catalysts or high temperatures in the absence of air to break down large hydrocarbon molecules into small hydrocarbon molecules. Re For example, one possible reaction when decane is cracked, the Using a catalyst equation is given as; can be made to fairly low temp High tenperskare The cracked vapors containing smaller molecules are separated by fractional distillation.

Building self-confidence\n\nContent: Building Self- Confidence H Z UNIT Dick and Jane Self-confidence is bow we feel about ourselves. It is best to feel good and proud of ourselves. Confidence is like good nutrition-the more we have it, the bealthier and stronger we become. By finding out how to create a safe and loving environment for yourself, you can help your self- confidence grow each day. LESS ON 1 Activity 1: Answer the following questions. Think of as many synonyms for self- confidence as you can. Why is it important to have self- confidence? What kind of a person would you be without self-confidence? Activity 2: Read the selection and answer the following questions. Building Self-Confidence < 1- Self-confidence is one of the most important characteristics of one's personality. It is the bedrock on which most other traits rest and it will do more to determine an individual's future than any other thing. Learning how to be self-confident is not that easy. Our teenage development years are influenced by many things, including what adults, other teenagers, and our families say or do to us. People's ill-chosen words or actions can hurt us and words of encouragement and support can make us feel good. When you were young, the way you felt about yourself may have depended greatly on how your family, teachers, friends, and even strangers treated you. Now, it is time to take control of how you feel about yourself. You need to know the difference between compliments and insults. You need to know how to become stronger when someone gives you words of encouragement and how to handle certain unpleasant situations, so they will not effect you negatively. 3- It is possible to go through life with low self-confidence, and, indeed, there are many people who do, but it is like trying to ride a bicycle with flat tires. It is much harder to do it that way. You need to recognize the importance of building your self-confidence. Start by treating other people well. The first step in building self-confidence is making others around us feel better. Try to help yourself live, love and learn. Create a nurturing environment where you can flourish. Here are 10 caring ways to connect with people around you every day. Confidence: Trust and believe in your own talents and in the abilities of others. Clear Communication: Express your emotions simply, and speak with others from the heart. Compassion: Honor all of your feelings, and listen to other people's feelings too. Creativity: Try new things, be playful, and don't be scared of things you don't know. Consistency: Do what you say, and say what you mean each day. Challenge: Approach problems positively, and learn from the challenges. Cheerfulness: Embrace the day with a light heart, and learn to enjoy life. Calmness: Breathe and live from a calm center within yourself each day. Clear Agreements: Create clear agreements and rules that everyone understands and feels good about. Commitments: Be committed to being true and honest to yourself each day. Adapted from: Loomans, Julia and Diane. Florida: Health Communications, Inc ., 1997. Why is it important to work on your self-confidence as teenagers? What are we greatly influenced by? What is the difference between how you felt about yourself a as a young person and how you feel about yourself now? Can you live with little self-confidence? If so, how can that affect you? When you are self-confident, what is the next step to take to become a better person? Explain why do you think that helps? Activity 3: Work on vocabulary. Complete Exercise 1 in the Workbook. 11 Activity 4: Word derivations are different forms of words. Many words change part of speech when you add certain suffixes to them. Sometimes a verb can become a noun when you add the letters -ion- at the end. For example, the verb automate becomes a noun when you change it to automation. Work on word derivations by completing Exercise 2 in the Workbook. Activity 5: Find out more about your self-confidence. Complete Exercise 3 in the Workbook. Assignment Keep a journal about your feelings for one day. Complete Exercise 4 in the Workbook. Be ready to share your findings with your group tomorrow. 12 LE SS Activity 1: In groups, share the information you collected from your journal yesterday. Then, discuss the relationship between the way others treat you and how much self- confidence you have. Activity 2: Discuss the following questions. How do you feel when the people around you support you and motivate you to do well? Think of an example from your personal life and share it. How do you feel when the people around you show they don't think you can do something or you are not good enough to do it? Think of an example from your personal life and share it. Activity 3: Look at the pictures and tell your group what you think the selection, 'Broken Wing' may be about. Activity 4: FOOD Study the glossary of words. Then, read the story and answer the questions that follow. 13 Glossary Doomed (adj) : can not avoid it Cringe (v.) : make a face showing unhappiness about something Retreat (n.) : camp Overview (n) : brief description of something Firestorm (n). : a big argument Drive (n) : a group effort Yield (v) : produce D Broken Wing < You were born with wings. Why prefer to crawl through life? Some people are just doomed to be failures. That's the way some adults look at troubled kids. Maybe you've heard the saying, \"A bird with a broken wing will never fly as high.\" Ware was made to feel this way almost every day in school. By high school, TJ. was the biggest troublemaker in his town. Teachers cringed when they saw his name posted on the classroom lists for the next semester. He wasn't very talkative, didn't answer questions and got into lots of fights. He had failed almost every class by the time he entered his ninth grade, yet was being passed on each year to a higher grade level. Teachers didn't want to have him again the following year. T.J. was moving on, but definitely not moving up. 2- I met T.J. for the first time at a weekend leadership retreat. All the students at school had been invited to sign up for ACE training, a program designed to have students become more involved in their communities. T.J. was one of 405 students who signed up. When I showed up to lead their first retreat, the community leaders gave me this overview of the attendees: \"We have all kinds of students represented today, from the student body president to T.J. Ware, the boy with the longest troublemaker record in the history of town.\" 3- At the start of the retreat, TJ, was literally standing outside the circle of students, against the back wall, with that 'go ahead, impress me' look on his face. He didn't readily join the discussion groups and didn't seem to have much to say. But slowly, the interactive games drew him in. The ice really melted when the groups started building a list of positive and negative things that had occurred at school that year. T.J. had some definite thoughts on those situations. The other students in T.J.'s group welcomed his comments. All of a sudden, T.J. felt like a part of the group, and before long he was being treated like a leader. He was saying things that made a lot of sense, and everyone was listening. T.J. was a smart guy and he had some great ideas. T.J. was very active in all the sessions. By the end of the retreat, he had joined the Homeless Project team. He knew something about poverty, hunger and hopelessness. The other students on the team were impressed with his passionate concerns and ideas. The student council president would be taking his instructions from TJ. When T.J. showed up at school on Monday morning, he arrived to a firestorm. A group of teachers were protesting to the school principal about his being elected co-chairman. The very first community-wide service project was to be a giant food drive, organized by the Homeless Project team. These teachers couldn't believe that the principal would allow this crucial beginning to a three-year action plan to be placed in the incapable hands of T.J. Ware. They reminded the principal, \"He has a bad record. He'll probably steal half the food.\" Mr. Coggshall reminded them that the purpose of the ACE program was to uncover any positive passions that a student had and reinforce its practice until true change could take place. The teachers left the meeting with this in mind and decided to try to motivate T.J, just as his classmates had. By building TJ's self-confidence, maybe he wouldn't be as bad as he had been in the past. Maybe the problem was that people just needed to put their confidence in him. Two weeks later, T.J. and his friends led a group of students in a drive to collect food. They collected a school record: 2,854 cans of food in just two hours. It was enough to fill the empty shelves in two neighborhood centers, and the food took care of needy families in the area for 75 days. The local newspaper covered the event with a full-page article the next day. That newspaper story was posted on the mail bulletin board at school, where everyone could see it. TJ.'s picture was up there for doing something great, for leading a record-setting food drive. Every day he was reminded about what he did. He was being acknowledged as a leader. 8- T.J. started showing up to school every day and answering questions from teachers for the first time. He led a second project, collecting 300 blankets and 1000 pairs of shoes for the homeless shelter. The event he started now yields 9,000 cans of food in one day, taking care of 70 percent of the need for food for one year. T.J. reminds us that a bird with a broken wing only needs mending. But once it has healed, it can fly higher than the rest. He is flying quite nicely these days. He is a confident young man. Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul. Florida: Health Communications, Inc ., 1997. At what point in the story do you think TJ.'s self-confidence began to grow? 2. How did his involvement in the group affect his behavior? 3. How did support from TJ.'s classmates and teachers prove to create a productive young man? How did the recognition of TJ.'s efforts effect him? Activity 5: In pairs, decide which is the main idea of each paragraph in the selection. Paragraph 1: a. Troubled kids should never be allowed to pass to the next grade. Ware always had problems doing well at school. Paragraph 2: a. The ACE training camp was designed for troubled students. The ACE training camp was designed to attract all types of students. Once T.J. showed interest in group activities, his leadership skills started to show. b. T.J. just didn't want to participate with the group. Paragraph 4: a. T.J. knew everything about poor people. Because of T.J.'s leadership skills and knowledge about poor people, he was voted as the co-chairman of the team. Activity 6: Write the main idea of the remainder of the paragraphs in the selection. Complete Exercise 5 in the Workbook. 16 LESS ON 3 < Activity 1: Reread the selection \"Broken Wing\" in Lesson two, and in your group, organize the events in chronological order. Complete Exercise 6 in the Workbook. Activity 2: Use the details in \"Broken Wing\" to complete Exercise 7 in the Workbook. Activity 3: As you have learned, students in other countries make an effort to help their communities. You too can help the poor people, old people, or even the community itself. In your group, think of as many ways as you can that YOU too could make a difference in your community. Then, share your ideas with the class. If one of the ideas is acceptable, maybe the class can work on doing it as a class project. Activity 4: Work on helping others improve themselves and learn to take constructive criticism well. Complete Exercise 8 in the Workbook. The new school year has just started and there is a new student in your ninth grade class. On the first day, the teacher introduces him/her to you, but no one makes a move at lunchtime to try to get to know him/her better. You can tell he/she feels uncomfortable. In your group, prepare a poster that clearly shows how you would invite the new student to be your friend and include him/her in your group. How would you help him/her build self-confidence in this new environment? Be ready to present your poster in Lesson five. LESS ON 4 Activity 1: Think of all the things you do for others to please them. Now, tell whether you do these -things because you are under pressure to do so or because you want to. If you are under pressure, try to figure out why. Activity 2: In groups, read the selection and decide whether the questions that follow are True or False. D Get in the Habit O 1- Becoming more self-confident is not easy. The older you are though, the easier it becomes. There are habits that you can work on adopting that will help you. Habits are things you do repeatedly, but most of the time you are hardly aware that you have them. Some habits are good and others are bad. Good habits include exercising regularly and showing respect for others. Bad habits include lying and hurting other people's feelings. 2- We must improve ourselves before we can improve others. If you want to make a change in your life, the place to begin is with yourself, not with your parents, or your teacher. How you feel about yourself is the most important element to work on. Stand up for yourself and resist bad peer pressure. Don't worry about pleasing everyone else to be popular. Find a talent and work on it. Developing a talent helps build self-confidence. Be happy for the successes of others. Be honest and kind to others. While doing all these things, remember not to expect yourself to be perfect. People make mistakes and so do we. Learn from them and try to be a better person tomorrow. 18 Building self-confidence starts with being you. Take responsibility for your life. Do what you want to do wisely. Make decisions and work toward achieving them. You know what makes you happy and sad. You can't control everything that happens to you, but you can control what you do about it. Don't let other people influence your mood. If something bad happens, bounce back. How many times are your parents driving down the highway and someone suddenly cuts in front of them, making them slam on their brakes? Well, they should just let it go, laugh about it, and move on. Find a way to make things work. It is the power to act. Then, since you are the driver of your own life, decide where you want to go and draw up a map to get there. Do you have a clear picture of who you want to be one year from now? You don't have to decide your whole life, but you should know which direction you are going in. Thinking beyond today can really be quite exciting since it involves turning your dreams into realities. Know that what you do today can really affect you later, Uncover your talents. Once you do that, half the job is done. If you don't decide for yourself, someone will do it for you. It is important to prioritize and manage your time so that your first things come first. You have a list of goals and good intentions, but doing them and putting them first is the hard part. You need to build your will-power. That is the strength to say yes to your most important things and no to less important things and to peer pressure. The better you organize yourself, the more you'll be able to pack in more time for family and friends, more time for school, and more time for yourself, more time for your first things. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens. If you know how to, becoming self-confident is one of the easiest things to do. Doing things others want you to do is your first priority. You need to please everyone around you. Then they will respect you morc. Plan the things you want to do and you will get them donc. 19 C Activity 3: Part of building self-confidence is setting goals and trying to meet them. In groups, choose two activities from the list below and plan how you are going to do them. Record what happens when you do them and be ready to present your results in Lesson 8. Dear Saw Thank you somuch for helping me on my project Last week ... 1. Go out of your way to say hello to the most lonely person you know. 2. Write a thank-you note to someone who has made a difference in your life, like a friend, teacher, or coach. 3. Find a talent you have and work on it. If you tell jokes well, then make someone laugh. If you draw well, then paint a picture. If you are generous, then give someone something. If you get in a fight with a parent or a friend, be the first to apologize. 5. Don't lose your temper if someone bumps into you in the hall, calls you a name, or cuts in line. 6. Identify your most unhealthy habit. Make up your mind to get rid of it. What are you going to do? 20 Activity 4: Based on what paragraph three advises you to do about making decisions wisely, read the problem below and choose the best solution for it in groups of two. Be ready to support your choice. Problem: Karim is a new student in the ninth grade. He has always played football on the after school football team. He would like to play football at his new school, but Nabil, the tough captain, is afraid Karim will take his place as team captain and doesn't want him to play, Solution: a. Karim should tell the coach to make Nabil allow him to join the team. b. Karim should get to know Nabil and show him that he won't threaten his position as captain of the football team. Then he should ask Nabil if he can join the team. 21 LESS ON Activity 1: In order to help your new classmate build his/her self-confidence in his/her new school atmosphere, present the poster you prepared from Lesson three. Activity 2: If you had to rate how well you are doing in your most important relationships, how would you score? On your own, reach each question and circle the number that best describes your relationship with the following people and share your answers with your group. How are your relationships with .... 1 2 3 4 5 Your siblings? 1 2 3 4 5 Your parents or guardian? 1 2 3 4 5 Your teachers? 1 2 3 4 5 Activity 3: Read the selection and then complete Exercise 9 in the Workbook in your group. D Get in the Habit-II 1. Why is success with self so important to success with others? Your next habit depends on you and your relationships with others. You should always keep your promises. Do small acts of kindness. Think about what that means to someone else, not what you would want it to mean only. Sometimes we do things for others even though we do not want to, but because we know it will mean a lot to the other person. Loyal people keep secrets and avoid gossip. They also stick up for others. Saying you are sorry when you yell, overreact, or make a stupid mistake can quickly make someone else feel better. But it takes guts to go to a friend and say, \"I was wrong.\" \"I apologize\" or \"I'm sorry.\" Do not send vague messages. 2- Another important habit is to seek first to understand, then to be understood. This means that you should listen first and then speak. Understand the other person's point of view first to understand whom you are dealing with. Then you can help them with their problem. The last important habit to build is recognizing that there are differences between people and that it is O.K. to be different. The worst thing one could do is try to copy others or try to act like someone he is not. People will accept you for who you are without your having to please them, Everyone has different styles, traits, and characteristics. We learn differently and we do things differently. What is good for you may not be good for another and vice versa. Your acceptance of others will build your character. Read this poem and see how impossible it is for two people to be exactly alike. Not one of them Is like another. Building self-confidence is not an easy task. It takes time, patience and desire.

Activity 2: Read the following selection in groups and then work on vocabulary by completing Exercise 11 in the Workbook. D Setting Goals One of the most important steps in building self-confidence is setting goals. It is the process of making a dream come true step-by-step. The desire to meet a challenge and succeed has been a part of many cultures throughout history. For example, the ancient Peruvians used to draw out their goals in symbols and paint them in primitive paintings on the walls of caves. They believed that writing out a dream in advance would assure a positive outcome. Here are a few simple steps to follow to help you set goals successfully. Seven Principles for Setting Goals 1. Listen First: Encourage yourself to become quiet and listen to yourself before setting a goal. Many goals are set for the wrong reasons. One should not set a goal because he is competing with someone else. It should be because one wants to build his integrity. Go over these vital questions before setring goals: Is this goal something I really want? Will this goal help me in my life right now? What will I need to do to bring this dream into reality? Once these questions have been answered, you can begin to create a plan to set a goal. 25 2. Create Smart Goals: Getting clear and specific about goals will help to create a personal map to success. If the goal is something that you truly want and is realistic, it will probably be easier for you to achieve it. Consider five key questions when helping yourself to set \"smart\" goals: Sensible Does it make sense to do this? How will I feel when I have arrived? Attainable Can I actually reach this goal now? Realistic Is it possible and realistic at this time? Time line How much time will it take me? See it and Believe it: Once the goal has been set, encourage yourself to begin to see it as though you had already done it. Drawing out goals in pictures or writing them down in vivid detail are great ways to keep the energy flowing in a positive direction. Once you have set the goals, this will be the most important step to focus on cach day. 4. Set Monthly Goals: Setting one or two-month goals is a good way to practice the principles and see results quickly. For example, a family of four can select one main goal per month each, along with a chart for marking down their progress on the refrigerator. Each person places a star on a winning day. They don't believe in failure , and they claim that they only have two kinds of days - \"I did it\" days and \"Give it all you've got tomorrow\" days. At the end of the month they have an \"Excellence Dinner' to celebrate their success. 5. Set Yearly Goals: Consider creating goals for the year in the following categories. For example, make yearly goal-setting a family affair. = I will get good grades in all my subjects. money - I will try to save as much pocket money as I can. learning = I will study as much as I can to learn from my teachers. = I will work out and exercise to improve my shape. = I will be kind to my family and friends and try to help them in any way possible. Break these down into bite-size pieces by creating goals for the month, and read over the yearly goals at least once a week. 6. Reward Your Progress: Rewards can provide a fun lift along the way. Create small weekly or monthly rewards to stay motivated, since every step along the way is a step toward success and should be acknowledged! Give one another hugs, pats on the back, cheers. If someone slips, support that person in getting back on track. 20 7- Be Willing to Let It All Go: Sometimes something unexpected appears, and that might mean that change is needed. Being willing to drop a goal in favor of something more realistic creates more courage and wisdom. Encourage yourself to remain open to changes. There is an expression that says, \" If you move with change. Adapted from: Loomans, Diane and Julia. HJ Kramer Inc ., 1994. Activity 3: Fill in the outline of the selection.

What is the difference between amateur and professional craftsmen? 2. How can crafts be used in occupational therapy? Why did the Arts and Crafts Movement begin in England? 1- Crafts are as old as human history. Originally fulfilling utilitarian purposes, they are now a means of producing beautiful handmade objects in a world dominated by mechanization. Among the earliest crafts are basketry, weaving, and pottery. Nearly every craft now practiced can be traced back many hundreds or even thousands of years. Crafts today include weaving, basket making, embroidery, quilting, pottery, woodworking, and jewelry making. They are made by amateur craftsmen at home as a hobby, and by professionals with regular markets for their products. 2- Crafts are used in occupational therapy. For example, patients may be taught crafts to strengthen weak muscles. Emotionally disturbed people are also taught crafts as an outlet for feelings. Crafts also provide the disabled with an occupation that diverts attention from their handicaps. Prisoners-of-wars have also been known to produce crafts of high quality. 32 Crafts work formed the basis of town and city economies in many parts of the world until the Industrial Revolution. Suddenly in the carly 19th century there were huge factories manufacturing millions of items. Goods which had formerly been made by craftsmen / women were now being made by machines. Once items could be mass-produced individual artisans were no longer needed. In reaction to the effects of industrialization, the Arts and Crafts Movement began in England. The adherents of the movement wanted a different society. On the whole, they failed, despite the fact that there is still today a strong interest in crafts all over the world.

Your teacher will explain to you the procedure for planning, carrying out, preparing the final report, and presenting your project to the class. The assignment is due in Lesson 8 of this unit. 33 LE ON 2 Activity 1: Listen to your teacher's explanation about the use of the past and past continuous tenses. The simple past describes an action of short duration in the past. Example: I met a craftsman and we talked for a few minutes. The past tense describes actions that took place over a period of time in the past. Example: The craftsman made crafts for ten years. The past tense describes past habitual actions. Example: When the craftsman was in his shop, he enjoyed his work. Also, remember that: 1. With a point in time, the past continuous tense expresses actions that began before the time given and probably continued after it. The exact beginning and end of the action is unknown. At 8:00 a.m. the craftsman was working in his shop. 2. With a period of time, the past continuous expresses an action that continued for a long period. Again, we do not know exactly when the action began or ended. Example: Yesterday morning, the craftsman was making a statue. 3. During a period of time, the past continuous expresses the beginning and ending of an action. Example: From 8:00-11:00 yesterday morning, the craftsman was carving the stone. The past continuous expresses two actions that were happening at the same time in the past. Example: The children were playing while the craftsman was working in his shop. The past continuous expresses an action that began before another action in the simple past and probably continued after it. Example: As the craftsman was working, a man stopped him and asked about the time. Also, remember that: In some sentences either the simple past or past continuous is possible. But with the past continuous, the speaker wants to emphasize the duration of an action. Note that the use of the simple past or the past continuous may be correct depending on the meaning of your sentence. Example: When I got up this morning, the craftsman worked in his shop. (He waited for me to get up). When I got up this morning, the craftsman was working in his shop. (He started working before I got up). Activity 2: In groups, complete Exercise 2 in the Workbook.

LEBANON IRAN PALESTINE JORDAN LIBYA KIWAI EGYPT QATAR SAUDIA ARABIA ? CHAD SUDAN DO KID & OMAY 37 D The Arts and Crafts of Ancient Lebanon About 250,000 years ago, as the Near East emerged from the Ice Age, an unknown species of Man settled on the coast of Lebanon. From the tools left behind there is proof that the ancient Man sought shelter in the natural caves of Lebanon. The earliest tool was a big hand axe which was used as a weapon for protection against enemy. It also enabled Man to hunt animals to eat and use their skins to clothe himself during the cold and rainy season. What distinguished the ancient Man of Lebanon was the ability to fashion tools out of stone. This was an important step in the cultural history of mankind as Man was able to use his imagination. This unknown primitive \"tool maker\" was Lebanon's first artisan. 2- The discovery of fire enabled Man to improve his hand-made tools. He could now heat rocks and produce more pointed and cutting tools. He hunted and gathered wild berries and seeds to nourish himself and his kin. A few seeds cast inadvertently in front of his cave taught Man that he could plant and cultivate his own crops. From a \"food gatherer\", he became a \"food producer\". This was the beginning of community life in Lebanon. 3- During the fifth millenium B. C. an artisan from Byblos built the first house with a crushed limestone floor. Later on, when Man started to believe in a supernatural force that controlled him and his environment, he engraved human features on a pebble and created Lebanon's first idol of stone. ? With the introduction of the potter's wheel in the fourth Millenium B .C. the artisan of Lebanon created pottery jars of all sizes and shapes. Several centuries after the potters, metal was discovered and the Lebanese bronze workers, silversmiths, and goldsmiths gave rein to their imagination. They produced fantastic ornaments, pots, and animal figures that demonstrated their creativity and artistic talent. Adapted from: Beirut National Museum. Activity 4: Read the selection once more and complete the step chart in Exercise 6 in the Workbook. Activity 5: Give an oral summary of what you have learned about the Arts and crafts of Ancient Lebanon. LESS ON OActivity 1: Your teacher will explain to you about the use of the past perfect tense. Listen carefully and remember that: 1. Speakers of English use the past perfect tense to talk about an action in the past that happened before another action in the past. The first past action is in the past perfect. The second action is in the simple past. The past perfect indicates that the first action was finished completely before the second action. Example: When I visited the craftsman, he had already made the statue. The past perfect usually occurs with the simple past, but the past perfect can be the only tense in a sentence if a specific past time is given. By five o'clock, the craftsman had finished the statue. I had not known he was such a skillful artist. The time words of \"After\" and \"Before\" are used with the past perfect and tell by themselves which action came first. Example: After I visited the craftsman, he gave me the statue. The craftsman gave me an appointment before I came to his shop. The words of \"By the Time\" and \"When\" do not tell which action came first. Therefore, the first action must be in the past perfect. The craftsman had started his work by the time I visited him. Whew I had told the craftsman my reason for coming, he gave me the statue. If two actions happened at the same time in the past, only the simple past is necessary. The words of \"Just\", \"Already\", and \"Scarcely\" are often used with the past perfect to indicate recency when followed by another past action. The craftsman had just gotten in when I knocked on the door. When I received the statue, the craftsman had already started working. I had scarcely closed the door when the craftsman was occupied by his work. The past perfect continuous tense is formed with had + been + present participle. The craftsman had been working on the statue for an hour. Note that the past perfect continuous is used to emphasize the continuous nature of the earlier past action and the recency of an carlier action. Furthermore, the past perfect continuous is not used when you mention the number of times something was done. Correct: The craftsman did not sell the statue because he had changed it three times. The craftsman did not sell the statue because he had been changing it three times. Activity 2: In groups complete Exercise 7 in the Workbook.

The Story of Silk in Lebanon < - Raw silk was a rare and costly item which came from the Far East to Rome at the beginning of the Christian era. Under Justinian a monopoly of the trade was reserved to the Emperor and looms, worked by women, were set up in the imperial palace. At this time two Persian monks, who had long resided in China and there learned the craft of silkworm rearing. arrived at Constantipole and imparted their knowledge to the Emperor. Hie induced them to return to China and attempt to bring back the material necessary for the cultivation of silk. This, the monks did, by concealing the eggs of the silkworm in a hollow canc. From the precious contents of that bamboo walking-stick were produced all races and varieties of the silkworm. Since Lebanon was known for its weaving and purple dyeing techniques, especially ancient Tyre, the Emperor decided to send over some silk worm eggs. This is how the inhabitants of these regions learned the \"secrets\" of silk production. For centuries silk has played an important role in Lebanon. At first mountain villages were the leading centers of silk production. Here silk artisans took care of the mulberry trees, rearing silk worm and harvesting cocoons. Later the industry spread throughout the Lebanese mountains. Rearing of the silkworm and the reeling of the cocoon was often entrusted to women. The silk was reeled on the \"Arabic wheel\" which resembled a large wheel without a rim. Silk reeled on this wheel was imperfect and could not be used by the European weaving industries. Therefore, silk men of Lyon founded the first \"modern\" silk factory at Btater. By 1851 the male factory reelers were paid 4 Piasters for a day's work which started at dawn and ended at dusk. Although the salary of the women was low, it was the first time that a woman artisans task was being remunerated by money in Lebanon. Adapted from: Kartbaoui, J. (1979).

IT'S FOR THE BIRDS < 1- Birds are mysterious creatures. Have you ever just sat and watched them of listened to them? Have you ever wondered how they can fly, or why they fly South for the Winter? Here are some bird-related craft projects. 2- If you want to be able to see more birds around your house, you should try making bird feeders to attract different kinds of birds. Different kinds of birds prefer different kinds of feeders and different kinds of seed. Let's look at what we can do to help provide the birds with food. 3- Bird feeding isn't just a winter activity. It might surprise you to learn that even in Spring, food is still scarce for our feathered friends. The temperatures are usually cool enough that many insect populations haven't emerged, and that's sad news for those birds who eat insects. Also, the fruit eating birds won't see their favorite foods naturally appearing until harvest! In addition, everyone is always so eager to get outdoors as soon as Spring arrives, that it is the perfect time to get yourself involved with bird feeding and bird watching. Then, by the time winter arrives, those birds who remain over winter in your area will know where the food is. Of course, it will be up to YOU to keep their dinner table supplied! TIP: Remember to check out the bird books at your local LIBRARY for specific details on birds, their favorite foods and favorite styles of dining table. For now, I have listed some basic points to get you started. I also give directions for building a simple bird feeder. You don't need to buy fancy bird feeders to feed your backyard friends. You can: * Set a pie tin on a stool or flat topped tree trunk or hang it in a hanging plant hanger; dump it out after a rain, or punch drainage holes in it, and elevate it a little by placing small rocks or twigs beneath it. (All birds, specially Juncos, Cardinals, Jays, Sparrows) * Punch holes on either side of a plastic pop bottle, stick a twig all the way through with its ends sticking out for perches and poke more holes nearby for the birds to pull the seeds out. Then hang the bottle by tying a string around its neck. Coat a pine cone with peanut butter, roll it in birdseed, and hang it from a tree branch; * Stick a piece of bread, a doughnut, or half of an orange, on a twiggy branch of the tree (the Orioles will LOVE the orange!) * Tie a string around the neck of a baby food jar and fill with orange juice. Hang it from a tree. (It will hang tilted, but Orioles will perch on the rim and take dainty sips). Scatter bread crumbs on the ground.

Scientists use the laws and principles of science to satisfy only their curiosity and not to solve man's problems. 4. Sociologists and archeologists do not use scientific thinking in their researches. When a scientist begins to search for natural laws and principles, he uses the following order of a scientific method: experimentation, deduction, observation, and hypothesis. 48 D Science Science began with the urge to explore the natural world - the stars and the planets, the weather and earthquakes, the composition of gold, the variety and origins of animals, and the actions of bacteria. It has gone on to probe ever deeper into the make up of living and non-living things, how they developed and how they continue to change and evolve, how they behave, the qualities they have, and why. From endless experiments, careful observations and inspired speculation, scientists try to discover not only reasons, but also common patterns and underlying principles, which help to explain the smallest nuclear sub-particle and the massive supernova star, the tiniest microbe and the giant dinosaur. But science has its practical side too, and either deliberately or by accident plays a part in trying to solve problems, such as the causes of crippling disease or of a fault in a metal structure. Scientists may choose to do 'applied' research of this kind, but more often than not it needs basic work, too, to find out how a particular part of the body or a metal is made up, for instance, before it is possible to see what has gone wrong. Pure and applied work do not go into separate watertight compartments and most scientific discoveries, however theoretical, sooner or later turn out to have some practical value of some kind, simply because science is about the real world. The tools and techniques developed for scientific research, both the very exacting methods of experiment and testing, and the sophisticated equipment, like electron microscopes which magnify down to the most minute levels, or oscilloscopes, or computers, have also found uses outside the lab - in industry, for instance, in measuring chemicals as they go through a conversion process, or in hospitals, monitoring patients in intensive care. Science stretches from the most abstract and theoretical thought (c.g. proving mathematically the existence of 'black holes' in space), to the most practical (c.g. developing a new moth proofer for wool or improving a brewing process). And even scientific thinking, the rigorous and exact methods by which scientists observe, deduce, hypothesize, and experiment, are now widely adapted for use outside the sciences, from archaeology to social sciences and management services.

Based on the title and the first paragraph, predict what the selection is about. Activity 3 Read the selection to find if your predictions are correct. Answer the questions that follow. Resembling Parents < 1- We look like our parents because of complex biological processes, which we call heredity. Parents and children tend to be similar in many characteristics- structural, physiological and psychological. However, the young are not exact duplicates of their parents and usually differ in many traits. The science of the study of heredity is attributed to Gregor Mendel. He was the first person to trace the characteristics of successive generations of living things. His work was so brilliant and unprecedented at the time it appeared that it took thirty-four years for the rest of the scientific community to catch up with it. Mendel studied pea plants and showed that inherited characteristics were the result of paired elementary units of heredity, which we now call genes. These he symbolized by letters. A characteristic of one parent, such as tallness, which appeared in progeny to the exclusion of another, was said to be dominant. A characteristic, which he intended not to reappear, was called recessive. Later researchers have shown that the genes are carried by structures called chromosomes. The human body of a newborn infant has some 200,000 million cells. These cells arise through the division of other cells. When they divide, their nuclei divide also by a process called mitosis. During mitosis the nuclei resolve themselves into structures called chromosomes, which divide lengthwise. All body cells have true copies of all chromosomes that were present in the fertilized egg from which the body developed. Mendel's work became the foundation of modern genetics. The impact of genetic theory is no longer questioned in anyone's mind. Many diseases are to be inherited, and pedigrees are typically traced to determine the probability of passing along a heredity disease. Plants are now designed in laboratories to exhibit desired characteristics. The practical result of Mendel's research has not only changed the way we perceive the world, but also the way we live in it. Glossary Heredity (n) : the property of organic beings by which offspring have the nature and characteristics of their parents and ancestors Unprecedented (adj) : having no precedent; that has not previously occurred Successive (adj) : coming one after another in an interrupted sequence Trait (n) : a characteristic feature of mind or character, a distinguishing quality Dominance (n) The fact or position of being dominant (Genetics) Genetics (n) : the branch of science that deals with heredity Pedigree (n) the origin and the history of something Progeny (n) : the young of humans or animals Chromosome (n) : any of the tiny parts like threads in animals and plants cells, carrying genetic information on the particular characteristics that each animal or plant will have 52 1.

(Reasons for teaching the blind practical skills) 4. 5. (Braille's invention) 6. (Your own question) Challenging blindness 7- One day a small boy crept into his father's workshop to play. He had often seen his father making shoes and he decided he would like to try. He picked up an awl, a sharp. pointed tool used for making holes in leather. As he bent over, the awl slipped and pierced his eye, destroying it forever. Some time later his other eye became infected by the first and he lost his sight altogether. So how did this child, blinded at the age of 4, become one of the most famous Frenchmen ever to live? Louis Braille was born in a small town near Paris in 1809. Despite his impaired vision the young child attended the village school with his sighted friends for two years. Eventually it became clear that he would not be able to learn much more, largely because he could not read or write. Without an education it was likely that he would have to beg on the street, like other blind people. At the age of ten he was lucky enough to be sent to a school for blind boys in Paris, one of the first in the world. Conditions in the school were very harsh. The building was damp and unhealthy and discipline was severe. Pupils who misbehaved were beaten, locked up and given stale bread and water. In fact this kind of discipline was common in all schools at that time. Life was harsh for nearly everyone and most sighted children left school at the age of 12 and went to work in factories or down mines. 5- At the school in Paris, the blind pupils were taught practical skills such as chair caning and slipper making, so that when they left the school they would be able to make a living. Once a week after lunch, the boys were taken for a walk in the park, linked together by a long rope. They were also taught to read but not to write. The letters they read were raised above the surface of the page so that they could feel them with their fingertips. This form of writing was very difficult to read because it was very hard to tell the letters apart. The letters were printed by pressing copper wire into one side of the paper to make a raised shape on the other. Because each individual letter had to be made out of wire first and because the wire then had to be forced into the paper with a press, blind people were unable to write anything for themselves. One day something happened that changed their lives forever. In 1821 a soldier named Charles Barbier came to visit the school. He brought with him a system he had invented called night writing. Night writing had originally been designed so that soldiers could pass instructions along trenches at night without having to talk and give their positions away. It consisted of twelve raised dots that could be combined to represent different sounds. Unfortunately, it proved to be too complex for soldiers to master, and was therefore rejected by the army. The young Louis Braille quickly realized how useful this system of raised dots could be, provided it was simplified. Over the next few months he experimented with different systems until he found an ideal one using six dots. He continued to work on the scheme for several years after, and developed separate codes for math and music. In 1827, the first book in Braille was published. Even so, the new system did not catch on immediately. Sighted people did not understand how useful Braille could be, and one head teacher at the school even banned children from learning it. Fortunately, this seemed to have the effect of encouraging the children even more and they took to learning it in secret. Eventually, even sighted people began to realize the benefits of the new system. 10- Not only could people with impaired vision read Braille, but they could also write it by themselves using simple stylus to make the dots. For the first time they became truly independent and took control of their own lives. 11- Louis Braille eventually became a teacher in the school where he had been a student. He was admired and respected by his pupils but, unfortunately, he did not live to see his system widely adopted. He had always been plagued by ill health and at the age of 43, he died from tuberculosis. For a while, it seemed as if his system would die with him. Fortunately, a few key people had realized the importance of his invention. In 1868, a group of four blind men, led by Dr Thomas Armitage, founded the British and Foreign Society for Improving the Embossed Literature of the Blind. This small band of friends grew and grew to become the Royal National Organization for People with Impaired Vision. 13- By 1990, Braille was being used in almost every country of the world and had been adapted to almost every known language, from Albanian to Zulu. In France itself, Louis Braille's achievement was finally recognized by the state. In 1952, his body was moved to Paris where it was buried in the Pantheon, the home of France's national heroes, Adapted from: The RNIB Webteam 1998.

Dec 19, 1999 22:01:48 TO: James zaak@lynx.ib From: Stere Czarnecki HYPERLINK mailto:ana@acay.com.au lan.acy.com.au Subject: Advances in communication technology 59 Ah, James, if only I knew ......... 1- I read something yesterday that said if you asked a farmer 100 years ago what kind of advance he'd like to see in farming in the next century, he'd be likely to say something along the lines of \"a horse twice as strong that eats half as much oats\". Little did farmers of the era realize that by the turn of the century in industrialized countries the draft horse would largely be a relic of picture books, a display animal at museum farms, and a pet of hobby farmers, replaced by the diesel tractor, or that the \"he\" doing the farming would increasingly also be a \"she\". 2- The point being that predicting the future of technology is notoriously risky business: the major advances are unseen until, in hindsight, they are obvious. In 1899, the telegraph was old hat, and even the telephone was an invention of one's parent's generation. On the cutting edge was Marconi's work on a device that would communicate with the electromagnetic waves demonstrated by Hertz a few years previously, and predicted by Maxwell only a decade or two earlier. Planck was trying to puzzle out the mystery of energy distributions for black body radiation, which lead to the idea of the quantum. Deforest was still half a decade from inventing the vacuum tube, allowing amplification of weak electrical signals. It would take another 40 years for Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain to harness the quantum to create the transistor, and another 15 for Schawlow and Townes to demonstrate the laser about the same time the first satellite (Sputnik) was launched. While the transistor was being invented, Turing was busy theorizing about the general purpose computer, and Von Neumann was describing how to build one. By the end of the 1960s, satellite telephone and television began to create the global village we take for granted today. The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency funded construction of a computer network called Arpanet. By the early 80s, experimental networks were combined to form the internet. Meanwhile, continuing advances in the manufacture of integrated circuits allowed digital signal processing to be implemented in small, cheap packages, giving rise to fast computer modems, the fax machine, and the cell telephone. Who, in 1899, would have predicted any of this? Who, in 1999, can confidently predict the world of communications in 2099? What fool will rush in where angels fear to tread? First, people who study trends and attempt to predict the future are called, quite unimaginatively, futurologists. Science fiction writers have a remarkably prescient view of the future, not being burdened too much by current-day constraints on technology. My prediction regarding communications is that having tested the benefit of interconnection, we will continue the process until virtual reality is \"real reality\". That is, our senses will no longer be limited to the here and now. The ultimate user interface will be a direct neural stimulation and output. Our eyes will become cameras, and our ears, microphones. We will touch, taste, and smell remotely. We will share direct brain- brain links, achieving \"mind-meld\" with others. The blind will see and the deaf will hear. We will have new sensory perceptions using wave lengths inaccessible to us today. We will feel as joined to another person on the other side of the world as we do to a person sitting next to us on a couch. And that's not accounting for breakthroughs in electronics, which will continue to get smaller, faster, and cheaper. It's easy to see that communication bandwidth will continue to climb (what's the limit? Maybe it's when the per capita bandwidth for each person in the world equals the total sensory information rate of sight, sound, touch, etc .? ) The only scientific breakthrough in the scenario above is understanding how to relate neutral impulses to sensory information (and the first crude steps are being researched today), and, with more difficulty, converting between thoughts and neural impulses. This kind of communication will change our sense of ourselves and the world, just as modern communications and jet travel has shaped our current perception of connectedness. Just as photography; indeed, they can create a credible reality independent of the physical world. The world has only started to communicate. Last month I heard a statistic that only half of the people in the world have ever made a phone call, and only 5 percent of the world's population has ever accessed the Web or sent or received an e-mail. That's an awful lot of people, but we haven't seen anything yet! Hope this stimulates some thinking.

Choose one of these discoveries to show its importance in our life. 1- Medicine is concerned with the transplant surgery today. Surgeons have discovered that kidneys can be grafted successfully where donor and recipient are closely related but, if they are not, the patient's body rejects the new organ. 2- The first human heart transplant took place in South Africa. A team of 20 surgeons, headed by Dr Christiaan Barnard, operated on Louis Washkansky, aged 55, using the heart of a 24-year-old donor, who had been killed in a road accident. 3- Both the donor and the recipient were of the same blood group and the heart was kept in cooled oxygenated blood for more than three hours before the transplantation. The operation took five hours and the new heart was only half the size of Washkansky's. The operation itself was a success, and within a few days Washkanksy was sitting up, eating and talking happily. The doctors were anxious about transplant rejection by the body and also post-operative infection that, in fact, did kill Washkanksy within a month of the transplant. In January 1968 a second transplant was carried out on Phillip Bliaberg, a 58-year-old dentist, who subsequently overcame a severe liver infection and lung condition, thought to be the result of his body trying to reject the new heart. The end of 1968 had carried out more than 100 transplants in the United States, Britain, France, India, South America, Canada, and Czechoslovakia. More than 40 patients survived. Bliaberg remained alive until August 17, 1969 and other patients survived for up to two and a half years. The operation is still successfully performed in different countries including Lebanon. In 1997, for example, in the U.S. about 2300 hearts were transplanted. Nowadays, the transplant surgery lasts up to seven hours and sometimes longer. Glossary Graft (v) : a healthy organ or piece of skin, bone, etc removed from a living body and attached to a damaged part of the same or another body; transplant Transplant (n) : the action of taking tissue or an organ from one person, animal, or part of a body and put it into another Surgeon (n) : a doctor who performs medical operation Rejection (n) : refusing to accept Infection (n) : a disease caught esp by breathing in bacteria, etc. from the air Activity 2: Scan the selection for unfamiliar words.

Activity 4: Read the selection below, and then, based on what you have read, use the right- hand column in Exercise 2 in the Workbook to tick ( V ) T for true and F for false. 6.8 1- The Olympic Games is an international athletic competition held every four years at a different site. It is a modified revival of the ancient Greek Olympian Games which date back to 776 B.C. The modern games were inaugurated in the spring of 1896, held in Athens, Greece, as a sign of respect to the Greeks' long history of devotion to physical beauty and the training of mind and body to the highest state of coordination. In a circular dated Jan 1, 1894, Baron Pierre de Coubertin - the founder of the modern Olympic Games - wrote, \"Under 980 conditions conformable to the needs of modern life, the re- establishment of the Olympic Games would bring together every four years representatives of all nations, and it is permissible to suppose that these peaceful and courteous contests would supply the best of internationalism.\" 2- The Olympic Games have always included a number of ceremonies, many of which emphasize the themes of international friendship and peaceful cooperation. Over the years, these ceremonies have evolved into a complex extravaganza of music, dancing, spectacular shows, fireworks, and speeches. 3- An elaborate ceremony traditionally opens the Olympic Games. It includes the parade of nations, in which teams from different nations enter the main 000 stadium in alphabetical order according to the name of their countries. The Greek team always enters first, to commemorate the ancient origins of the modern games, and the team of the host nation always enters last. The Olympic Hymn is then played, and the official Olympic Flag, with its five interlocking rings of different colors against a white background representing unity among the nations of the five continents, is raised. The torch relay, which symbolizes the transmission of Olympic ideals from ancient Greece to the modern world, is introduced as part of the opening ceremony. In the relay the torch is lit initially by rays of the sun at Olympia, Greece, and is carried over several weeks or months to the host city by a series of runners. After the last runner has lit the Olympic Flame in the main Olympic stadium, the host country's head of state declares the games officially open, and doves are released to symbolize the peaceful spirit of the games. Another ceremonial procedure introduced in 1920 was the first reciting of the Olympic Oath, taken in the name of all the athletes by a member of the host team. The oath asserts the athletes' commitment to the ideals of friendliness and sportsmanship in competition. Medal ceremonies are also an important part of the games. After each individual event during the games, medals are awarded in a ceremony to the first -, second -, and third- place finishers. The ceremony occurs after each event, when the three winning contestants mount a podium to receive gold, silver, and bronze medals respectively. While the national flags of all three competitors are hoisted, the national anthem of the winner's country is played. The games end by the closing parade of nations. At that stage, the athletes break ranks and mingle together in the main stadium to celebrate the occasion with music and dancing. The president of the IOC (International Olympic Committee) declares the games ended and invites the athletes and spectators to meet at the site of the next games after a lapse of four years.

Find two instances in Paragraph 3 where word groups that come between the subject and the predicate are ignored. Subject-Verb Agreement The subject of a sentence must agree with its predicate in number: singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs. 1. Collective nouns, such as: army committee dub das family public staff majorityjury are all singular in form but may be singular or plural in usage a. When we think of a collective noun as a single undivided body, we use a singular verb. The team meets for training every other day. The audience was generous with their cheers and applause. When we think of the noun as individual members in the group, we use a plural verb. After winning the match, the team were carried round the playground on shoulder bigb. The majority of the players come from different European countries. 2. Quantity nouns which express some amount also may be singular or plural. If the quantity is measured as a whole, it takes a singular verb. Fifty thousand people is too much a crowd for a tennis game. If the quantity is expressed or can be measured item by item, it takes a plural verb. Fifty thousand people bave bought tickets for the match. When word groups come between the subject and predicate, ignore them for the purpose of agreement. The main referee, as well as the two linesmen, has considered it a foul play.

Activity 3: Study the illustrations below, and then scan the selection to name the team sport of cach. a. b. einek C. d. 74 - Field Hockey is a stick-and-ball game in which two teams compete against each other, each attempting to pass the ball in order to gain ground and advantage as a prelude to scoring a goal. The outdoor sport can either be played on a grass of artificial turf field of 100 yd. long by 60 yd. wide. The goals, situated at the center of each goal line, are 4 yd. wide and 7 ft. high. A hooked stick may be of any length to suit an individual player, but it must be made of wood. The ball may be of any material, but it should weigh about 5.5 oz. and have a circumference of about 9 in. A game lasts 70 minutes ( 35 minutes cach way) with a half-time interval of 10 minutes. It is controlled by two umpires, one for each half of the field, mostly remaining outside the field of play. Each team is composed of five forwards, supported by three halfbacks, two fullbacks, plus a goalkeeper. Gradually other systems evolved leading to a variety of more flexible formations, with players usually classified simply as attackers, midfield players, and defenders. Polo is a team sport of four players who both defend and attack at the same time. Each player mounts on horseback and uses a long mallet to attempt to drive a small wooden or plastic ball through the opponent's goal. The game is played on a field no more than 300 yd. long and from 180 to 200 yd. wide. A goal consisting of two uprights 8 yd. apart, is set up at the center of each end line of the field. The ball used, formerly made of wood, is now plastic, and it is 3.5 in. in diameter and 5 oz. in weight The mallet has a wooden head and a thin, flexible, bamboo or graphite handle. Protective equipment consists of helmets and kneepads, and leg bandages for the horse. The normal game is divided into six periods, or chukkas, of 7 minutes and 30 seconds cach. Ties are resolved in an extra, \"sudden death\" period or periods, in which the first team to score wins Rugby Football is 15-a-side-field game - eight forwards and seven backs. It is a hard fast- moving sport which needs a high degree of fitness to play well. The standard pitch is not more than 110 yd. of length and 73 yd. of width. The goalposts are 18.5 ft. apart and have a crossbar of 10 ft. above ground. The ball is oval and has the approximate dimensions of 11 in. length, 23.5 circumference, and weighs 15 oz. The game has two 40-minutes halves with a 5-minute interval. Not only does one referee control the game, but also there are two touch judges or linesmen as most people call them. Points are scored either by a \"try\", scored by a player placing the ball on the ground in his opponents' in-goal area, or by a \"goal\", achieved by kicking the ball by a place-kick over the crossbar and between the uprights. The game begins with a place-kick from the middle of the center line. It is restarted in the same way after points have been scored. Thereafter, each team tries to gain as much possession of the ball as possible and, by passing maneuvers, to score tries. Team Handball is a court or field game which has features in common with baseball and soccer. The ball is an inflated sphere covered with leather. It has a circumference of 24 in. The court is 21.87 yd. wide and 43,74 yd long. A match is divided into two 30-minute halves. As an indoor game, each team has seven players on the court, one goalkeeper and six who play both offense and defense. Players throw, pass, bounce, or strike the ball with their hands, arms, head, body, thighs, or knees. The object of the game is to throw the ball into the opposing goal, which counts for one point. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to use his or her feet, but only to stop the ball from entering the goal, not to kick it. Players (except for the goalkeeper) may only hold the ball for up to three seconds and take up to three steps while holding it.

D OWENMANIA < FAME AND FORTUNE 1- Michael Owen's meteoric rise to stardom has seen the boy who was virtually unknown a short time ago being voted the fourth-best footballer in the world in a recent sportswriters' poll - and he's still only 19. But the boy who took the World Cup by storm when he scored that famous goal against Argentina is very modest about his soaring success. 2- It's no wonder now that he has a five-year contract with Liverpool, who wanted to insure him for $100 million. This huge amount of money, which takes into account his transfer value and what the club earns from advertisements, sales of shirts and souvenirs, would top the reported $ 82.5 million coverage that Inter-Milan has placed on Brazil's superstar, Ronaldo. His huge footy talent started sprouting when he was at school. By the time he was 11. eight league clubs had tried to get him on their books. Despite being an Everton fan, Michael went to Liverpool to train in 1991. He scored 11 goals in five appearances as Liverpool won the FA Youth Championship for the first time, so it wasn't long before he got to play with the big boys. But it was at France '98 that Owen earned his 'boy wonder' title - and all the fame and adulation that came with it. He started the World Cup on the bench, but as England trailed Romania one-nil the crowd were shouting for him and coach Glenn Hoddle had no choice but to give the young fella a chance. He made the right decision - Owen scored the equalizer. 5- Owenmania gripped the nation, and then his goal against Argentina catapulted him to worldwide fame. But his feet remain firmly on the ground. \"I've always been confident I would make it to the top, but for it to happen so quickly has surprised me,\" admits Michael. To him, it's the chance to do a job he loves, never mind the fame and fortune. And there's no denying he's doing what he's best at: he has all-round ability, confidence and scarily fast pace - not to mention nice legs. 6- Michael's life has changed in a big way since the World Cup. He's pursued by thousands of adoring fans and can't go anywhere without being recognized. He still lives in his tiny home town with his family, near Chester, but his parents' home is a target for adoring fans. It must be bewildering and flattering to have to deal with all that kind of stuff, but Michael takes it all in his stride.

Naval Air Station, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on a routine training mission. The planes were supposed to carry three-man crews, but one crew member failed to show. It could PUERTORICO have been just coincidence, or was it premonition? The experienced crew had done their required pre-flight test and everything checked out in good working order. The planes had extensive radio equipment and homing devices that would show them the way home. The first message came from the patrol at 15:45, \"Control tower, this is an emergency. We seem to be off course. We can't make out where we are.\" The tower said, \"Head due west\", but the flight did not know which way west was. \"Everything looks wrong, even the ocean looks strange\". Even if the compasses were not working, the crew should have been able to fly west by following the sun (which was several hours from setting.) Finally, around 16:25, the flight leader announced, \"We're not certain where we are,\" and then silence. Despite one of the world's most extensive search efforts, involving 300 planes and dozens of ships, the flight was never heard from again, and no trace of the planes was ever found. A rescue plane was sent to search for the missing aircraft and it, too, disappeared. The military experts were completely baffled. How could 27 men and six planes just disappear? If the planes had run out of fuel, they would have floated long enough for the crews to get out and onto their rafts. The men were well-trained in sea survival. The official Navy report stated that the planes had vanished \"as if they had flown to Mars.\" This is just one of the extraordinary stories of ships and planes which vanished into thin air in an area in the Western Atlantic, known as Bermuda Triangle. Among sailors, it is known as the Triangle of Death, the Limbo of the Lost, the Hoodoo Sea, the Graveyard of the Atlantic, or a host of other names. It is called a triangle due to its imaginary three-sided segment , extending from Bermuda in the north to southern Florida, and then cast to Puerto Rico, and then back again to Bermuda. This area occupies a disturbing and almost incredible place in the world's catalog of unexplained mysteries where more than 50 ships and 20 aircraft sailed into oblivion, and more than a thousand lives have been lost without a single trace or even a piece of wreckage from the vanishing planes or ships. Another notorious case of the Triangle's victims was USS Cydops, a 500-feet cargo ship. that disappeared on March 4, 1918. Investigations revealed neither evidence of foul weather, nor messages of help, wreckage, or any sign of the 300 men aboard. Stranger yet are the numerous \"ghost\" ships that have been found floating within the triangle completely abandoned by their crew. One of these ships was the Mary Celeste, a 103-foot cargo vessel found deserted in 1872, about 400 miles off its intended course from New York to Genoa. The ship was in perfect shape, with sails set, but there was no sign of its crew of ten nor of the only lifeboat on board. In 1881, the cargo ship Ellen Austin discovered a schooner, sails flapping in the wind, a full cargo of mahogany intact, but no sign of human life. The captain of the Ellen Austin installed a new crew to sail it, but two days later, during a rough storm, the ship was lost, and no trace of the schooner or the new crew was ever found.

(Due for discussion in Lesson 6 and presentation in Lesson 8.) 96 LESSON 3 Activity 1: In groups, ask two questions based on Part I of the selection. Make sure that the answers to your questions may help you understand the mystery of the disappearances in Bermuda Triangle. Activity 2: Some interesting theories that tried to explain the mysteries of the disappearances are presented in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Part II of the selection. However, these paragraphs are divided into two parts. Read the selection and join the paragraphs appropriately. In recent years, the triangle aroused considerable public interest through hot-selling books and a television documentary, narrated by horror master Vincent Price. Countless theories attempting to explain the many disappearances have been offered throughout the history of the area. Unfortunately, none of them has produced convincing answers. however, there is no shortage of interesting and unfamiliar stories. 2 - a- One of the practical explanations There, be believes, most of the missing vessels and attributed to the mystery is human error. ships and their crens may still be on display for study The \"Devil's Triangle\" is one of the only by these higher intelligences. \"It sounds weird,\" he two places on earth where a compass admits, \"until you realize that it's the only needle points towards true north.

The Gulf Stream is extremely in deep trouble. swift and turbulent and can quickly erase any evidence of a disaster. The unpredictable Atlantic weather also plays its role. 4- He expands upon the theory that a giant No reasonable explanation to date solar crystal, which once supplied power for has been made for the disappearing Atlantis, lies on the ocean floor.

One expert on ocean currents at Yale University, who asked not to be identified, exploded into laughter at the mention of the triangle and said, \"We confidently, and without any hesitation, often go to sea and work in that area.\" Adapted from: articles published by Department of the Navy - Naval Historical Center y.

Read the selection and check your answers. creatures victims death danger blood heart peace prisoners evil happiness thirst power > THE MYTH OF DRACULA <1 6- Myths and legends abound in all cultures and literature. They are re-enacted and passed on through generations via ritual and story-telling. In some cases, they mirror the morality of the culture within the myths, In other cases, the myths represent the ideals that a culture aspires to and present goals that people and society should attempt to reach. That is why historical accuracy is unimportant in a myth. It is the story they tell, the messages they convey, and the ideals they represent that make myths important to any culture. 2- The myths of vampires as undead creatures that prey upon living victims in order to perpetuate their own life is part of nearly every culture in one form or another. What we know today of vampires comes primarily from Bram Stoker's \"Dracula.\" Stoker was an Irish- born writer who spent seven years researching vampire legends before compiling these legends into the book and tale we know today. The version we know today from the Dracula novel is a compilation of hundreds of vampire stories. His realm is the time of evil (nighttime) and his bed the embodiment of death (a coffin). Vampires can change into creatures in order to flee danger. He lives by seducing and attacking living victims and drinking their blood, thus transferring their life into his. b As long as the vampire can find victims and is able to sleep in his coffin during daylight, he will live forever. There are only a few ways to keep a vampire at bay. Holy water will burn a vampire so they will not approach. Garlic or wolf bay placed around a door or window sill will keep them away. One can drive a stake through their heart or expose them to daylight. One is sure when a vampire dies because it rapidly decomposes to the ash and dirt it would have become had it rested in peace for all its centuries. 5- Bram Stoker added a number of elements to the basic story, creating the legend we are familiar with today. He based his character on a real person. Vlad Tepes was born in 1431 in the Wallachia region of Transylvania (modern day Romania). He ruled the region on three separate occasions in the mid 1450s d He liked to take prisoners and impale them with a spear, leaving them to die slowly with a stick through their stomach or chest. Vlad became known as \"The Impale\" because of his gruesome acts. It is estimated that during his second reign he had 10,000 prisoners, political opponents, and innocent victims impaled on stakes. During his second reign he took on the name of his father, Dracole, and became known as Vlad Dracula. 6- When imprisoned in 1456, Dracula continued his blood thirst on helpless animals such as mice and birds. Following his release and a war with the Turks, Dracula gained power over Transylvania for a third time before finally being killed by Turkish soldiers. The common thread that runs through all the legends of vampires is the story of the human dream. Man has dreamt throughout the ages to gain supernatural power of wealth, strength, and eternal youth. In a sense, these qualities were the motives behind the evil nature of Dracula's character as well as the demons that all of us confront within ourselves. Adapted from: Eileen Holland www.open-sesame.com Glossary Myth (n) : an ancient story dealing with supernatural beings Reenact: (v) i to perform again Ritual (n) : a ceremonial act Aspire (v) : to have a great ambition or ultimate goal Vampire (n) : a dead person that is believed to rise from the grave at night to suck the blood of people Prey (n) : to hunt and eat Embodiment (n) ; the act of giving a bodily form to something Seduce (v) : to lead away Reign (n) : the period during which someone in power rules a country Impale (v) : to pierce with a sharp point O Activity 3: The following sentences are taken from the selection. Read the selection and decide where they should go. There are even fewer ways to kill a vampire. By the time of his death it was estimated that he killed nearly 1 out of every 10 people living in the region (more than 40,000). A vampire is an undead creature, a human without à soul. While in charge, he took joy from torturing and killing victims. The victim in turn dies, and also becomes a vampire. He would then hold great feasts where he dipped bread into glasses of blood taken from the victims. 07 Activity 4: In groups, discuss the answers to these questions. - What is a vampire ? Why does the writer consider a myth tery significant ? - What suggestions are offered to get rid of a vampire ? Is Dracula a real or an imaginary character ?

What superstitions are you familiar with ? Do you believe in them? Why or why not ? 3. Where do you think they come from ? Activity 2: Read the following list of superstitions and check the ones you are familiar with. Who decided Friday the 13th was an unlucky day? Why should breaking a mirror bring us bad luck? The superstitions of our forefathers are still very much alive today. Some of them have remained unchanged for hundreds and even thousand of years. Why do we still believe in them? It's bad luck to put a hat on a bed. 2. You must get out of bed on the same side that you get in or you will have bad luck. If you blow out all the candles on your birthday cake with the first puff you will get your wish. If you say good-bye to a friend on a bridge, you will never see each other again. To prevent an unwelcome guest from returning, sweep out the room they stayed in immediately after they leave. If a black cat walks towards you, it brings good fortune, but if it walks away, it takes the good luck with it. It is bad luck to light three cigarettes with the same match. If you count the number of fish you caught, you will catch no more that day. To drop a cup, a glass, or a plate means an evil spell has gone away. If the palm of your right hand itches, it means you will soon be getting money. If the palm of your left hand itches, it means you will soon be paying out money. A horseshoe, hung above the doorway, will bring good luck to a home. A knife placed under the pillow prevents nightmares. It is bad luck to walk under a ladder. To break a mirror means you will have seven years of bad luck 15. An onion cut in half and placed under the bed of a sick person will draw off fever 16. If you use the same pencil to take a test that you used for studying for the test, the pencil will remember the .13 answers. Bad luck will follow the spilling of salt unless a pinch is thrown over the left shoulder into the face of the devil waiting there. Put salt on the doorstep of a new house and no evil can enter. Do not place shoes upon a table, for this will bring bad luck for the day. It's bad luck to leave shoes upside down. The devil can enter your body when you sneeze. Having someone say, \"God Bless you\" drives the devil away. If you bite your tongue while eating, it is because you have recently told a lic. It's bad luck to open an umbrella inside the house, especially if you put it over your head. Knock three times on wood after mentioning good fortune so evil spirits won't ruin it. If you make a wish while throwing a coin into a well or fountain, the wish will come truc. If a dead person's eyes are left open, he'll find someone to take with him. If a mirror in the house falls and breaks by itself, someone in the house will die soon. If 3 people are photographed together, the one in the middle will die first. Activity 3: Adapted from: Brain Candy's Trivia Collections. Use the chart in Exercise 11 in the Workbook to sort the list of superstitions into three groups. Activity 4: Compare and contrast the list of superstitions to superstitions in your native culture. Activity 5: Read the following anecdote. Identify the superstitions stated and implied, and then discuss the writer's attitude. 110 D THE PERFECT DAY < Just imagine you wake up at the sound of the alarm and you notice that it's Friday the 13th! You stagger into the bathroom, drop the mirror, and bingo! Seven years of bad luck! It is really going to be your day! During the preparations of breakfast, you manage to burn the toast . Burnt bread, naturally, feeds the devil, and he will be lurking very close behind to avoid the salt that you will for sure be throwing into his eyes. As you leave your house on your weary way to work, you avoid anything that might offend the fates. You carefully step around it. What a relief, but the wind catches you unaware, and you sneeze. It happened so quickly that you didn't have time to put your hand in front of your mouth. Now you are in trouble for sure, for your soul has unceremoniously escaped from your body. You arrive at work, surprisingly still in one piece. While considering your bad luck so far, you hear a colleague saying, \"Well, you sure got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning!\" You mumble something about it being Friday the 13th and stagger to your desk. Tripping over your own feet, you look down at your shoes and realize that a lace is let loose! Now apart from the intense embarrassment involved that you are walking around, like a bum, with a loose shoelace, you realize that thunder and lightening will strike before noon. In order to fix your laces, you place the shoe on your desk. There will be a serious quarrel at home tonight. The shoe also must never be worn again, for such shoes can only be used for the long walk into the underworld. Sure, you are by now convinced that, if this day isn't your last, then certainly you will be fired from your job, have a serious accident, end up divorced and be mutilated for the rest of your life. Eventually, somehow the day passes and you are still miraculously alive. On your way back home, you meet a black cat running away from you. Pretend not to see it! Well done, a narrow escape on such a foggy and rainy day. In your excitement of success, you enter the house in a hurry with the umbrella over your head. Before you realized that, you see your old hat just lying on the bed. You can't avoid the devil this time !!

The old man's beard was glazed by winter's frost while he waited for a ride across the river, The wait seemed endless. His body became numb and stiff from the frigid north wind. 2- He heard the faint, steady rhythm of approaching hooves galloping along the frozen path. Anxiously, he watched as several horsemen approached him. He let the first one pass by without an effort to get his attention. Then another passed by, and another. Finally, the last rider neared the spot where the old man sat like a statue. As this one drew near, the old man caught the rider's eye and said . \"Sir, would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side? There doesn't appear to be a passageway by foot.\" 16 3- Reining his horse, the rider replied. Seeing the old man was unable to lift his half-frozen body from the ground, the horseman took the old man not just across the river, but to his destination, which was a few miles away. As they neared the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman's curiosity caused him to inquire, \"Sir, I noticed that you let several other riders pass by without making an effort to secure a ride. Then I came up and you immediately asked me for a ride. on such a bitter winter night, you would wait and ask the last rider. What if I had refused and left you there?\" The old man lowered himself slowly down from the horse, looked the rider straight in the eyes, and replied, \"I've been around these here parts for some time. I reckon I know people pretty good\". The old-timer continued, \"I looked in to the eyes of the riders and immediately saw there was no concern for my situation. It would have been useless even to ask them for a ride. But when I looked in to your eyes, kindness and compassion were evident. I knew, then and there, that your gentle spirit would welcome the opportunity to give me assistance in my time of need.\" 5- Those heartwarming comments touched the horseman deeply. \"I'm most grateful for what you have said,\" he told the old man. \"May I never get too busy in my own affairs that I fail to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion.\" 6- With that, Thomas Jefferson turned his horse around and made his way back to the White House.

Activity 5: Read the story one more time and complete the chart of story events in Exercise 5 in the Workbook. 117 LE SS ON 3 Activity 1: Retell the story \"Compassion is in the Eyes\". Activity 2: Your teacher will assign you a character from the story to describe. In your group, determine the main traits of the character that you would like to emphasize in your description and look for evidence from the story to support your description and share what you have written with the class. Activity 3: Learn about reporting commands and requests. Remember that when reporting commands the words order in the indirect statement is as follows: Affirmative: Sit down. She told me to sit down. She told me not to sit down. In addition to \"tell,\" the words in the box below are often used to introduce commands Order, Command, Warn, direct - Also, remember that while a command is an order given by someone in authority. a request is something asked for, usually in a polite manner. - \"Will you,\" \"would you,\" and \"could you\" are often used to introduce requests. When used for requests, they are expressed in indirect speech by: ask + indirect object + infinitive. She said, \"will you help me? She asked me to help her. Scan the story \"Compassion is in the Eyes\" to identify any requests or commands made by the characters. Then express the requests and commands in the indirect speech. Activity 4: Imagine that you were one of the characters in the story. Write a journal entry in response to what you have experienced that day. Use the first person voice and share what you have written with the class. 18 LE SS ON 4 Activity 1: Read the title of the story below. Then look at the accompanying illustrations and say what the story may be about. Activity 2: Complete Exercise 6 in the Workbook to learn the meaning of unfamiliar words. Activity 3: Read the first five paragraphs of the story and answer the following questions: 1. Who is Ms. Crocker and who is Little Man? 2. Why was Little Man in big trouble? What do you think will happen next? 1- At the beginning of the school year, Miss Crocker made a startling announcement: This year we would all have books. 2- Sitting so close to the desk, I could see that the covers of the books were badly worn and that the gray edges of the pages had been marred by pencils, crayons, and ink. My anticipation at having my own book turned into sinking disappointment. But Miss Crocker beamed with pride as the class anxiously watched the disappearing pile. 119 3- 1 glanced across at Little Man, his face lit in eager excitement. I knew that he could not see the soiled covers or the marred pages from where he sat. I did not like to think of his disappointment when he saw the books as they really are. But there was nothing that I could do about it, so I opened my book and began to browse through the spotted pages. Miss Crocker's voice droned on monotonously as she called the children to get their books. Suddenly, I grew conscious of a break in the monotonous tone and I looked up. Miss Crocker was staring fiercely down at Little Man, who was pushing a book upon the desk. - \"What is that you said, Clayton Chester Logan?\" The room became gravely silent. Little Man was in big trouble. His lips parted slightly as he took his hands off the book. He quivered, but he did not take his eyes from Miss Crocker. \"I said may I have another book please, ma'am, That one's dirty.\" Miss Crocker echoed, appalled by such temerity. She stood up, gazing down upon Little Man like a bony giant, but Little Man raised his head and continued to look into her eyes. And just who do you think you are, Clayton Chester? Here the country is giving us these wonderful books during these hard times and you're going to stand there and tell me that the book's too dirty? Now you take that book or get nothing at all!\" 7- Little Man lowered his eyes and said nothing as he stared at the book. For several moments he stood there, his face barely visible above the desk, then he turned and looked at the few remaining books and, seeming to realize that they were as badly soiled as the one Miss Crocker had given him, he looked across the room at me. I nodded and Little Man, glancing up again at Miss Crocker, slid the book from the edge of the desk, and with his back straight and his head up returned to his seat. Miss Crocker sat down again. \"Some people around here seem to be giving themselves airs. I'll tolerate no more of that, \"she scowled. \"Sharon Lake, come get your book.\" 8- I watched Little Man as he scooted into his seat beside two other little boys. He sat for a while with a stony face looking out the window; then, evidently accepting the fact that the book in front of him was the best that he could expect, he turned and opened it. But as he stared at the book's inside cover, his face clouded, changing from sulky acceptance to puzzlement. Then his eyes grew wide, and suddenly he sucked in his breath and sprang from his chair like a wounded animal, flinging the book onto the floor and stomping madly upon it. 120 9- Miss Crocker rushed to Little Man and grabbed him up in powerful hands. She shook him vigorously, then set him on the floor again. \"Now, just what's gotten into you, Clayton Chester?\" 10- But Little Man said nothing. He just stood staring down at the open book, shivering with indignant anger. 11- \"Pick it up,\" she ordered. \"No? I'll give you ten seconds to pick up that book, boy, or I'm going to get y switch.\" 12- Little Man bit his lower lip, and I knew that he was not going to pick up the book. I turned to the inside cover of my own book and saw immediately what had made Little Man so furious. Stamped on the inside cover was a chart which read: STOP HERE PROPERTY OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION Spokane County, Mississippi September, 1922 CHRONOLOGICAL DATE OF CONDITION RACE OF ISSUANCE ISSUANCE OF BOOK STUDENT 1 September 1922 New White 2 September 1925 Very Good White 3 September 1927 Good White 4 September 1930 Average White 5 September 1932 Poor White 6 September 1933 Very Poor nigra 7 8 Adapted from: De Saint-Exupery (1985).

Activity 4: Learn about detecting the mood in a selection. Remember that writers develop the mood of their writings by using certain words and expressions. For example, words like ghostly, deserted, haunted, and howling convey a scary mood. Meanwhile, words such as sparkling, shiny, and laughing convey a happy mood. Read paragraphs 6, 7, and 8 of the story to determine the mood the author tried to convey in each paragraph. In pairs, identify a list of words that convey a certain mood. Share your list of words with the class. Activity 5: Make a decision about the author's purpose of the story \"Hear My Cry.\" In pairs, decide whether the writer is trying to inform, entertain or persuade the reader. Share your response with the class and justify your answer. 123 LE SS ON Activity 1: Discuss the following questions. What do you think of the title of the story \"Hear My Cry?\" 2. Is the story up-to-date? What does the story tell us about the past history and culture of the United States of America? 4. Could the story happen in contemporary America? 5. Is the author of the story approaching the material logically or emotionally? What emotional words are mentioned in the story? Activity 2: Learn about the use of propaganda techniques to determine the author's point of view. Remember that some authors could be biased in their presentation of material. They use propaganda techniques to influence their readers. These techniques include: 1. Name calling- using negative labels (reactionary, troublemaker, etc.) to create negative reactions toward a person without providing evidence to support such impressions. 2. Glittering generalities-+ Using vague phrases to influence point of view without providing necessary specifics. Plain-folks talk- relating a person (for example, a politician) or a proposed program to the \"common people\" in order to get their support. 4. Card stacking- telling only one side of a story by ignoring information that favor the opposing point of view. Activity 3: Read the story once more and determine whether the author used any of the propaganda techniques mentioned above. Complete Exercise 10 in the Workbook. Discuss whether we can consider the author of the story biased or not. 124 LE SS ON Activity 1: Listen to your teacher's explanation of the functions of noun clauses.

In groups of five, list as many local or global environmental issues as you can. 2. Rearrange these issues according to their degree of seriousness in Lebanon? Activity 2: Learn the definitions of the bold-faced words in the selection then complete Exercise 1 in the Workbook. 1- Human beings have in recent years discovered that they may have succeeded in achieving a momentous but rather unwanted accomplishment. Because of our technology, it now seems likely that we have begun altering the climate of our planet. 2- Climatologists are confident that over the past century, the global average temperature has increased by about half a degree Celsius. This warming is thought to be at least partly the result of human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels in electric power plants and automobiles. Moreover, because populations are increasing, national economies and the use of technology are all growing and, the average global temperature is expected to continue increasing by an additional 1.0 to 3.5 degrees C by the year 2100. 3- Such warming is just one of many consequences that climate change can have. Nevertheless, the ways that warming might affect the planet's environment - and therefore, its life - are among the most compelling issues in earth science. Unfortunately, they are also among the most difficult to predict. The effects will be complex and vary considerably from place to place. Of particular interests are the changes in regional climate and local weather and especially extreme events - record temperatures, heat waves, very heavy rainfall, or drought, for example - which could very well have staggering effects on societies, agriculture and ecosystems. 128 4 Climate change would also effect the patterns of rainfall and other precipitation with some areas getting more and others less, changing global patterns and occurrences of droughts and floods. Researchers have two main - and complementary - methods of investigating these climate changes. Detailed meteorological records go back about a century, which coincides with the period during which the global average temperature increased by half a degree. By examining these measurements and records, climatologists are beginning to get a picture of how and where extremes of weather and climate have occurred. It is the relationship between these extremes and the overall temperature increase that really interests scientists. This is where another critical research tool(global ocean atmosphere climate models) comes in. These high-performance computer programs simulate the important processes of the atmosphere and oceans, giving researchers insights into the links between human activities and major weather and climate events. The combustion of fossil fuels, for example, increase the concentration in the atmosphere of certain greenhouse gases, the fundamental agents of the global warming that may be attributable to humans. These gases, which include carbon dioxide, methane, ozone and nitrous oxide, let in sunlight but tend to insulate the planet against the loss of heat, not unlike the glass of greenhouse. Thus, a higher concentration means a warmer climate. Of all the human-caused greenhouse gasses, carbon dioxide has by far the greatest impact on the global heat budget (calculated as the amount of heat absorbed by the planted less the amount radiated back into space). Contributing to carbon dioxide's greenhouse potency is its persistence: as much as forty percent of it tends to remain in the atmosphere for centuries. Accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide is promoted not only by combustion but also by tropical deforestation. The second most influential human-caused effect on the earth's radiation budget is probably that of aerosols, which are minute solid particles, sometimes covered by a liquid film, finely dispersed in the atmosphere. They, too, are produced by combustion, but they also come from natural sources, primarily volcanoes. By blocking or reflecting light, aerosols tend to mitigate global warming on regional and global scales. In contrast to carbon dioxide, aerosols have short atmospheric residence times (less than a week) and consequently are concentrated near their sources. At present, scientists are less certain about the radiative effects of aerosols than those of greenhouse gases. Adapted from : Scientific American, By Thomas R. Karl.

Untangling the Science of Climate 1- Life has prospered on this planet for nearly four billion years. In that time climate has changed frequently, from ice ages lasting tens of thousands of years to epochs of steamy heat . With each change various species have flourished. 2- Now, many experts believe, humans are endangering their own ecological wiche with the threat of global warming. The vaporous by-product of civilization, in the form of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), have trapped enough heat in the atmosphere to raise Earth's average surface air temperature by half a degree Celcius during this century. If the trend continues, it could alter climate patterns worldwide melting glaciers, boosting sea level, scorching plains into deserts, and shifting vegetation zones. Global climate depends on combinations of factors interacting in complex ways that we do not yet understand. It is possible that the warming observed during this century may have resulted from natural variations, even though the increase has been much more rapid than what the planet has witnessed over the past hundred centuries. Moreover, the supercomputer simulations used to project future conditions may not be accurate. 4- Nonetheless, in 1995, after years of intense study the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), sponsored by the United Nations, tentatively concluded that \"the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate\". The amount of that influence, the group noted, is unknown because of \"uncertainties in key factors,\" including the degree to which clouds and oceans affect the rate of temperature change. It may take a decade or more of additional research to resolve those uncertainties. 5- Meanwhile, much is known. And although the specific consequences of human activity remain ambiguous, our ability to alter the atmosphere cannot be disputed. Adapted from : National Geographic VOL .193 ,NO .5 May 1998.

Would life on Earth be possible? Activity 2: Read the selection and guess the meanings of the bold-faced words from context or word analysis. Identify the clues that helped you work out the answers. The air we breathe keeps us alive in more ways than one. Without our atmosphere, average global temperature would be minus 18°C instead of the present 15°C. All the incoming sunlight, with energy equivalent to about three 100-watt light bulbs per square yard, would strike the Earth's surface, causing it to emit infrared waves like a giant radiator. That heat would simply travel unimpeded back out to the void. 2- Because of the atmosphere, however, only a fraction of that heat makes it directly back into space. The rest is trapped in the lower air layers, which contain a number of gases- water vapor, CO2, methane, and others - that absorb the outgoing infrared radiation. As those gases heat up, some of their warmth radiates back down to the surface. The entire process is called the greenhouse effect, and the predominant greenhouse gas, water vapor, causes most of it. 3- With increased heating, more water vapor evaporates from oceans, lakes, and soils. Because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor, this creates a powerful feedback loop: The hotter it gets, the higher the water vapor content of the air, and thus the greater the greenhouse warming. + Human beings have little direct control over the volume of water in the atmosphere, but we produce other greenhouse gases that intensify the effect. The IPPC estimated that rising CO2 emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels, account for about 60 percent of the warming observed since 1850. Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing about 0.3 percent a year, and it is now about 30 percent higher than it was before the industrial revolution. If current rates continuc, it will rise to at least twice preindustrial levels by about 2060 - and by the end of the century could be four times as high. That is particularly worrisome because CO2 has a lifetime of more than a hundred years in the atmosphere, compared with eight days for water vapor. Methane, the principal ingredient of natural gas, has an estimated 15 percent of the warming in modern times. Generated by bacteria in rice fields, decomposing garbage. cattle manching, and fossil fuel production, methane persists in the atmosphere for nearly a decade and is now about 2.5 times as prevalent as it was in the 18th century. Other major greenhouse gases include nitrous oxide - produced by both agriculture and industry - and various solvents and refrigerants like chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs which are now banned by international treaty because of their damaging effect on Earth's protective ozone layer. The relentless accumulation of greenhouse gases has led the IPCC to project that in the next hundred years global average temperature will rise by 1 to 3.5 degrees C. That may not seem like much, yet the \"little ice age,\" an anomalous cold snap that peaked from 1570 to 1730 and forced European farmers to abandon their fields, was caused by a change of only half a degree C.

Activity 5: Do Exercise 11 in the Workbook to learn how a gerund is used in short prohibitions. 143 LE >Activity 1 Learn about the infinitives below. Then do Exercise 12 in the Workbook. Infinitives are verb forms like (to) write, (to) speak, (to) read, etc. Unlike verb tenses (c.g. writes, spoke, read) they do not usually show the actual times or events. Infinitives are generally used with the marker to. Like gerunds, infinitives can be used to fill the functions of nouns. Examples Functions To protest would have been useless. Subject They really wanted to demonstrate. Direct object His reaction against contaminating groundwater Complement was to complain. Infinitives can be also phrases. They can be modified by direct object or a subject complement. Examples Functions To plan a campaign for preserving our planet takes Subject of the sentence a good deal of thought.

The world used to be a very large place and it took people days and months to travel bere and there, but now there it is a very small place within which people and nations deal with one another daily. Activity 1: Consider the following situation and then answer the questions that follow. Set your calendar back 10,000 years. You are living in the days of the earliest people. You live in a cave with your family and you eat whatever you are able to catch or plant. You wear clothing made from animal skins. You have simple needs and do not need much to survive. 1. Remember that money has not been invented yet? How would you get things that you needed but did not have? 2. Where would you get them from? Activity 2: Read the selection and answer the questions that follow. The History of Money 1- 10.000 years ago in the time of the cavemen, money was not around so how did people buy things? They traded something they had for something else they wanted. This was also known as bartering. For example, let's say once civilizations began to develop, a blacksmith made tools and a farmer raised cows. If the farmer needed a tool and the blacksmith wanted a cow, then bartering worked well. But what if the blacksmith wanted a cow, and the farmer did not need any new tools? How could the blacksmith get what he wanted? Bartering was easy as long as there were only a few things to trade. People agreed on what could be traded for what. But as time went on and the number of items to swap increased, making deals got more complicated. Also, there were times when people didn't agree on the value of things. For example, how many monkeys would one trade for a canoe? Which was worth more, monkeys or coconuts? people had to carry around everything they wanted to barter with and that got very difficult. Bartering got so complicated that people looked for an easier way to trade. 148 Instead of bartering or trading with each other, people began to use a medium of exchange. The medium of exchange was used as a common measure of valuc. For instance, if shells had been the agreed-upon medium of exchange, the value of everything would have been measured and paid for in shells. Shoes might have cost fifteen shells. With an agreed-upon medium of exchange, buying and selling is a lot easier. Gradually, it became common to trade precious metals for goods. Bronze, silver or gold pieces which were made into small disks or coins were used as a medium of exchange. The earliest known coins were made in Asia Minor (now Turkey) about 700 B.C. by the people from a region called Lydia. 5- No matter what metals the coins were made of, carrying a lot of them was difficult. That is why paper money was invented. It was first used in China in the thirteenth century. The famous explorer Marco Polo first reported that the emperor Kublai Khan printed notes on paper. 6- Our currency system today still uses a mix of coin and paper money. Many people now also use checks and credit cards to purchase goods and services. Whatever forms of money we use today, they are definitely easier than trading tools for cows. The world has entered an electronic age and the latest form of cashless money is information stored in bank computers. People can have their paychecks electronically added to their bank accounts. Their bills can then be paid directly by the bank using advanced communication systems. No actual money changes hands. Everything is recorded by computers. Although thousands of years ago people could get along without money, today they depend on money and need it to survive. People work at jobs, trading their labor for the money they need to pay for the goods and services that make their lives comfortable. The marketplace has grown to include the whole world. Modern transportation has made it possible for all countries of the world to ship and receive goods from abroad. Nations trade with one another by exchanging goods: machinery for sugar or even oil for grain. Goods are traded in huge quantities in the world market. Money is a tool that has changed as the world has changed. Now it is changing again. No one knows for sure what the tool of trade will be in the future. United States of America; Clarion Books, 1993. 2. Why did people trade? What were the ways people paid for the things they needed? What are the ways people can pay for the things they buy? What was the major reason people started to use coins to buy things? Activity 3: Work on vocabulary.

Activity 2: Read the selection and answer the questions that follow: > Phoenician Trade Routes < In a world without airplanes, engine-powered ships, trucks, or even paved roads, how did people journey from one place to another? How did products that were found only in a very small part of the world eventually find their way across the continents? For almost five thousand years, people have been transporting products from one part of the world to another using trade routes. Traders from Europe, Asia, and Africa carried furs, spices, silks, pottery, knives, stone utensils, jewels and plenty of other commodities, exchanging things found in one area for the products found in another. 2- When trading first began, there were no real roads. Local traders might follow trails or cross steep mountain passes in their treks from one village to another. With the passage of time, trails might be widened and eventually paved. But the new paved roads tended to follow the old trade routes which established these routes as important links of communication between different cultures. 3- With the passage of time, sea-lanes became vital trade routes between the various continents, and made trade possible with North America, South America, and Australia. Many of the highways and seaways that have been used predominantly for trade throughout history have shaped its course of events because of the many ways in which the routes were used. 4- About 5000 B.C ., groups of Semitic people who came from other lands began trickling into what is now Lebanon, an area of nearly 250 km of seacoast with mountains and valleys behind it. Along the shores were excellent harbors where 5 principal cites were built: Aradus, Byblos, Beirut, Tyre and Sidon. There they learned to build boats and went to sea, trading up and down the coast with their neighbors at first and later venturing and exploring west into the Mediterranean. From their cities, these clever people conducted their trade and travels. 5- History tells that the Phoenicians were indeed the greatest sea traders of the ancient world. They had their start in the eastern Mediterranean in what is now part of Lebanon. They had an important influence in the commerce, the culture and the history of their world for nearly a thousand years. Over that long span, they spread westward throughout the Mediterranean. 6- Some time, about 3,200 years ago, a small trading vessel was poking its way along the southern coast of what is now Italy. There is no way of telling how it got into trouble, but it sank near Cape Gelidony, which lies off the coast of Sicily, in about 100 feet of water. In 1960, two young Americans decided to investigate the wreck. After much research into the age of the vessel, the Americans believed that the Gelidonya wreck was built by the Phoenicians, who were great sea traders. The Phoenicians have occupied a curious place in history for a long time. Through many references in ancient literature and in the works of classical historians, they earned their reputation as the outstanding seafarers, traders, traveling artisans, explorers and shipmakers of their day. They swapped and exchanged goods with Egyptians, Greeks, Assyrians, Babylonians, Africans and Spanish tribesmen. The entire Mediterranean world was their bazaar. They even went beyond it, out into the Atlantic, far down the African coast and possibly north to Brittany, France and the British Isles. Frank, I.

Complete Exercise 5 in the Workbook. Activity 4: Read the selection and decide whether the statements that follow are true or false. When people think of business, they think of companies making money. A company is an entity. It is a legal entity structured to carry on trade, services, or production of goods. The entity has its own name, way of doing things, and some say even a personality. 2- Business is an idea in the minds of the people who create and start it. That's why it is exciting. If we could do everything for ourselves all the time, we wouldn't need help from others. When others help us and get something in return, they are in business! A business must start with a good idea. Business is all the people who work to make it run. That includes the owners of the business, the secretaries, the management at all levels and much more. We know that businesses need to have a body (a legal entity), an invention or product to sell and a great place to sell that product, a personality (an image), a goal (business purpose), and a heart (its people) to be successful. 3- A business which is engaged in trade is one whose purpose is to sell something. Businesses that produce goods that department stores or car dealerships buy are called wholesalers. Department stores and car dealership which sell to us are called retailers. These businesses are in the retail trade and they sell to consumers. 4- A service business sells help, not things. For example, hairdressers, lawyers, doctors, and car mechanics sell their services to you, the consumer. A producer of goods manufactures things that are used by trade or service businesses. For example, soft drink companies make soft drinks and the supermarkets sell them. Businesses are developed so people can earn or receive income. Do you have an income now? Some teenagers around the world work outside their homes for extra cash during their summer vacations. They may get paid money, or wages, from a business or a shopkeeper. Most adults get their money by working for another person, a business, or the government. Or they run their own business. An employer pays his employees a salary, or a fixed sum of money. That's what you call a job. If you have a job, you can buy things. Consumers use goods and services. Even when you buy an ice cream, you are a consumer. A producer, on the other hand, may make the food you buy or serve you dinner at your favorite restaurant. The economy offers all the things people want and need. An economy includes people, natural resources, and the things people produce and consume. An economy works when all these factors interact with one another. It's all a matter of supply and demand, which is how much people want something and how much of that thing is available. If demand is greater than the supply, the price goes up. If the supply is greater than the demand, the price goes down. Godfrey, N. S. Kids' Money Book. United States of America: Simon & Schuster Children's Publishing, 1998. Businesses are created only to make money. A whole saler sells straight to you the consumer. 3. Employers pay employees at the end of the month. An economy can work without people, but with all other characteristics of businesses. When the demand for goods goes up, so does the price.

The planning went on for years, but it was not until February 7, 1992 at the signing of the Treaty of European Union in Maastricht that France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Finland, and Denmark created the European Community. This union was meant to strengthen the economic power of the European Community. In order to strengthen the economic power of the European Community, a monetary union developed. That means that currencies and money of all states of countries that are members of the union would be tied together at fixed exchange rate. Now these countries could trade and deal with each other with less tax limits by having all countries use the Euro. The Euro was originally meant to replace the national currencies of all member states. The Euro came into effect on January 1, 1999, but this included only monetary, capital, and foreign exchange markets. Six months later, all participants had completed the changeover and the Euro will have completely replaced all individual country currencies. The intended date for the introduction of the Euro notes and coins is January 1, 2002. 3- The main reasons behind the creation of the economic and monetary union (EMU) are easy to see. First, it is to open up borders between member countries. As a result, this will create free movement of labor, goods and capital. Moreover, it will remove taxes on supplies being traded between countries, and it will remove restrictions on trade. Basically, the goal of the EMU is to combine all the European Community countries so that they will work together as one. It will also create an open market that will make it easier to do business transactions between countries and it will allow several new opportunities for people to work in other countries. When the rest of the world sees that trade with European countries is becoming easier, the use of the Euro will attract a greater number of foreign traders, investors, and travelers. They will gain because they do not have to convert or change their currency from one to another. Moreover, consumers and companies will be able to compare costs for the same items in different countries which will definitely make prices more stable. 160 <Activity 4: Read the Grammar Focus below and complete Exercises 8 and 9 in the Workbook.

LEBANON Activity 2: Read the selection and complete Exercise 10 in the Workbook. The European Community and the Lebanese Economy Part II 1- Because Lebanon trades greatly with many countries in Europe, it realized that it would benefit its economy if it tried to participate in this union. The Lebanese government took important steps toward adopting the Euro. In February 1999, the Lebanese Central Bank borrowed 300 million Euros and $200 million from the European Central Bank. It put it in the reserves to use it in rebuilding the country. By making this move, Lebanon hopes to achieve a partnership with the European Community. 2- The Euro will help trade between Lebanese and European companies. Because Europe is the major importer of Lebanese products (52% of the imported goods to Lebanon), accounting done in the Euro and communications between the two will obviously be affected. Also, the Lebanese banking system will be greatly influenced because it will facilitate trade using the new European currency. 3- The 1975-1991 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's economy, cut its exports by half and removed Lebanon as the Middle Eastern banking center. The peace now has enabled the central government to collect taxes, and regain access to key port and government facilities. The weakened economy has also been supported by a solid banking system and several small-and medium-scale manufacturers. banking transactions, manufactured and farm exports, and international emergency aid are the main sources of foreign exchange. In 1991, industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed substantial gains. Over the last 8 years, there has been a great amount of improvement that has stabilized the Lebanese pound, which has gained value. The new administration has encouraged domestic and foreign investment and obtained much international assistance. Adapted from: The Ministry of Trade and Economy.

As little as 100 years ago, letters were sent by messangers and took weeks and sometimes months to arrive at their destinations. Today, because of the Internet, letters travel in just seconds to destinations thousands of kilometers away, The Internet has made aspects of everyday life, from politics and entertainment to communication and trade, easier to deal with. Most people who have a computer in their houses use the computer software to write letters, play games, and do projects with, and use the Internet to communicate, access information, and trade on. But on the Internet, 'trade' no longer means 'to exchange' goods and services like it did thousands of years ago and is not only conducted by traders, but it means 'to deal with' and includes everyone who has technological facilites, like the computer, in his house. Logging onto or using the Internet may not be the same as visiting the local shopping center, but the Internet is changing the way people shop, conduct their business transactions, and trade.

Do you feel that you can't communicate with them now because they are just too old and they don't know what you are going through? Well, you are wrong because your parents were teenagers once upon a time and they experienced good as well as bad times just like you do. Parents want to help you. They tell you they have been through a lot of the same things you are going through. The only problem sometimes seems to be how to . deal with them and how you want them to deal with you. If you can better understand parents, you can better deal with them. 2- The teenage or adolescent years contain joyful surprises as well as some disappointments for parents. Parents have great feelings watching you stretch toward adulthood, but that pleasure is often dampened by them realizing they can no longer totally 'control' what you do. When you are young, a parent can exercise more control over you because your world is limited. As soon as you leave home regularly, as in attending school, parents lose their ability to control every part of your life. You can make acquaintances from classmates and people from after school sports and activities. From these new references, you create opinions and make decisions and perhaps new values. You quickly learn that your choices are expanded in the world outside your homes. The older you get and the more people you meet, the more influenced you are from people other than your parents. The older you get, the less influence parents have. Parents control you by regulating your activities. You develop into adulthood and parents start realizing you are changing. The experiences an adolescent gains helps him develop a more independent identity that requires a move away from parental control. Each of you becomes a self-powered individual who can choose your own behavior, thoughts, and feelings. 5- Parents know there are bad things out there that can hurt a curious teenager like you, so they try to prevent you from getting into trouble. That's why sometimes conflicts arise because they want you to do things a certain way and you want to do things a different way. Peace between the generations is an attainable goal.

Do Exercise 3 in the Workbook. Activity 3: Read the selection and answer the questions that follow. D The Generation Gap 1- In earlier years while you are growing up, your direction is fairly well set by your parents. Parents choose the place you live, the school you attend, the playmates you spend time with, and the opportunities you have. You have very little voice in the choices parents make about your environment; you have to do what they tell you to. But as you grow older and begin to separate from your parents, you are faced with more and more independent decisions and greater responsibility for carrying them out. This in itself is a cause of friction between you and your parents' generations. You accuse parents of treating you like children, and in turn your parents often accuse you of acting childish. 2- It's no wonder that you can't figure out where you stand or when you're 'old enough' You may be old enough to be a baby sitter but not old enough to stay out late. You are old enough to cut the grass but not old enough to decide when it needs to be cut. Parents are always giving you contradictory messages. 3- Why is it so difficult to get along with your parents? It's the generation gap between you. 4- The first problem is that times have changed. Times are always changing, but in the past few years, things have changed so fast that you can not even follow what is happening. New technology such as the airplane is making distances seem shorter and faraway places closer. Progress has brought with it methods of communication, such as the internet, that allow people all over the world to communicate through the cheapest means possible. Information that used to be only found in libraries can now be found on the internet. That means we can find out what is happening on the other side of the planet within seconds of its happening. Things that used to be considered forbidden have now become very much accepted by the new generation in some countries. Long ago, young men and women were not allowed to go out and spend time together unless they were married, but today it is very normal for teenagers to socialize by doing lots of activities together. 5- Another thing that makes it difficult to get along with your parents is their own expectations of you. Sometimes, they expect you to behave and feel the way they want you to. Your thoughts or feelings are different from when they were your age. Parents also want you to do the things they could not achieve when they were your age. When you become adolescents, you start to think that you know what you want to do with your lives and that is where the conflict heightens. 6- Adolescence is a time of rapid change in the physical body. The physical development is earlier in some and later in others. With the outward signs come internal changes. New challenges arise in the teen years, and each of you must find your own way to cope with them. Some of you meet those challenges and do them successfully. Still others will be shielded from making necessary decisions by parents who mean well. No matter what happens during adolescence, at the end of that period you are young adults. How successfully you handle adult life depends largely on the kind of preparation you had 7- Finally, conflicting pressures make it difficult for young people in today's society. The generally accepted value system stresses independence, autonomy, and individual freedom, while the ideal of a family is for its members all to be involved in a close relationship. The adolescent has to cope with that in addition to trying to find a way to balance doing what parents instruct and what peers do. All of you know the comfort of being in a group of people whose company you enjoy, who like to do the same things you do, and who share your values and hopes. It isn't hard to see that sometimes the values of your friends conflict with the values of the family. Closing the generation gap seems to be the best way to balance the two. Being able to recognize things that may hurt teenagers and avoiding them and secing the things that will make them happy and doing them is the key to success.

Were they somehow excluded from those years of turmoil in the complicated cycle of life? Why do they say 'we understand' When they don't? Why Do they ask us to talk to them? Don't they realize the reason we won't is because we will be forever condemned for what we say in confidence and hope? We need this time to search and explore to reason and find out to be or not to be. We don't want to be told Who our friends should be or should not be We want to decide for ourselves. No This is our time Don't try to help You must realize that we will rebel Because each of us is an individual.

When I ask you to listen to me And you feel you have to do something To solve my problem, You have failed me, Strange as that may seem. All I ask is that you listen. Don't talk or do-just hear me. I can do for myself; I am not helpless. Maybe discouraged and faltering, But not helpless. When you do something for me that I can And need to do for myself, You contribute to my fear and Inadequacy. But when you accept as a simple fact That I feel what I feel, No matter how irrational, Then I can stop trying to convince You and get about this business Of understanding what's behind This irrational feeling. And when that's clear, the answers are Obvious and I don't need advice. Irrational feelings make sense when We understand what's behind them. Perhaps that's why prayer works, sometimes, God just listens and lets you work It out for yourself. And if you want to talk, wait a minute For your turn-and I will listen to you.

Raised in a rigid household, Ricky Smith found difficulty coping with his family. Turning into a teenager was one of the most difficult experiences he had to deal with. Why were things getting harder instead of easier? Why were his parents becoming more strict with him rather than more lenient? Why did they try to forbid him from spending time with his friends? Ricky realized that instead of trusting him more because he was getting older, they were doubting him more. When he asked them if he could go to the 7pm movies with his friends, he would get 100 questions from them. He felt like he was being interrogated. Normal questions like, \"Who are you going with?\" and \"What time are you coming home?\" would have been fine, but Mr. and Mrs. Smith asked him very disturbing questions. They wondered whether or not his friends drank or smoked. Why do you think Ricky's friends did bad things? 3- It was this year that Greg and Jeff, who were Ricky's childhood friends, had started experimenting with things. Sometimes, they smoked and drank which he knew was bad, but he wanted to hang out with them because he thought they were the coolest teenagers in high school. He knew if his parents found out what his friends were really doing, he would never be allowed to go out with them. To protect them, Ricky would get very defensive when his parents asked questions. \"My friends don't smoke and drink and neither do I! Why don't you believe me? Stop accusing me and my friends of those things !! Things were getting stressful with his parents. But Mr. and Mrs. Smith never gave up. \"We know that teenagers at your age are experimenting with good as well as bad and sometimes dangerous things. We just want what's best for you. We don't want you to hurt yourself. Even if you don't do the things your friends do, eventually, you will find that you are tempted to because they are doing them. That's why we forbid you from doing things sometimes.\" Then they would say things like, \"You know what happened last night? Four teenagers who were drinking alcohol in the car drove off the highway and died in a car crash. Ricky, it's not a good idea to drink and drive. You really shouldn't even be riding in a car which your friends are drinking in. I heard Greg and Jeff drink behind their parents' backs. You shouldn't hide things like that from us. They may be your best friends, but sometimes peer pressure can make you do things your really don't want to do. It's O.K. to say, 'No' to them if you don't want to do those things. Your generation is easily influenced by dangerous factors. Don't be foolish just to be cool.\" Do you think maybe Ricky's parents were too strict? Could they have dealt with Ricky a little bit better or were they doing the right thing? Ricky knew that if he tried to talk to them, it just wouldn't work. He thought it was because his parents belonged to a different generation. They did things differently when they were growing up. What Mr. Smith did with his friends for entertainment 25 or 30 years earlier was different from what teenagers were doing now. Teenagers these days did exciting things, of so Ricky thought. 6- It was the end-of-year-school dance. Ricky, Greg, and Jeff had planned to go. The guys had even convinced Ricky that it was time he had a drink with them on their 'big night out'. Greg and Jeff would pick Ricky up at 7:30pm. When they came over, Mr. Smith answered the door and didn't like what he saw. Greg and Jeff's eyes were very red and they were acting very weird, like they were trying to hide something. When Mr. Smith asked what was wrong, Greg quickly said that they were tired because they had been staying up late recently since they had had lots of final exams to do. Mr. Smith knew something was wrong. He told Greg and Jeff to wait in the living room and he went up to get Ricky. Ricky, whose parents loved him very much, was just putting his jacket on and was quite excited to go out. He turned to his dad and saw the look of fear in his dad's eyes. What do you think Mr. Smith said to Ricky? 180 Activity 3: Read the selection again and with a partner decide whether the statements are true or false. Ricky's parents' attitude didn't change as he was growing up into a teenager. The older Ricky got, the easier it was getting to deal with his parents. Ricky thought his parents asked him questions because they didn't want him to do anything fun with his friends. Mr. Smith always wanted Ricky to stay home because he missed him and wanted to spend time with him. Mr. Smith knew Greg and Jeff had been up to no good before coming to pick up Ricky.

Ricky knew this was going to be a fight. \"Come on dad, don't start that again. Greg and Jeff have been under a lot of pressure to pass the year, so they have been working really hard. Don't start accusing them of that stuff please?\" \"Ricky, I know you don't want to hear that your friends are doing things they shouldn't be doing, but I smelled alcohol on Greg's breath. I can not let you get in a car with a driver who has been drinking. It is very dangerous and who knows what will happen on the road. I know you are going to hate me, but I know there are going to be problems tonight if you go with your friends. I don't know how Greg's parents didn't see what he was doing, but I am not letting you get in that car with him. I will take you to the dance and if you want, your friends can come with us too.\" What was he going to do? Greg and Jeff were downstairs waiting for him. They had been planning this night for weeks. He wasn't about to let his dad stop him now !! \"You always do this to me! Just when I am about to have fun with my friends, you try and get in the way !! I am going and you are not going to stop me!\" With that, he turned his back and ran downstairs. What do you think happened when Ricky saw Greg? 182 2- Mr. Smith followed Ricky downstairs. He ran into the living room where his friends were waiting for him red-eyed. Ricky looked at Greg and knew Mr. Smith had been right. He came close to him and said, \"What's wrong with you? Why have you been drinking? It's 7 pm and you have already started drinking? We said we would do it there, but not before the dance.\" \"Oh, come on Ricky, I just had one drink! Ricky looked at Greg and then at his dad. He thought for one moment and he knew his dad was right. He looked at Greg and said, \"Um ... I think I am going to have my dad take me to the dance. Thank you for offering, but if you would like to come with us, you may.\" Greg immediately responded, \"Oh, come on! I promise not to have another drink tonight. You are such an idiot! Ricky said, \"If you think you are cool, think again. People who drink and drive are not cool. \"If I promise not to have another drink, will you come then?\" Ricky had heard that promise before. He knew it would not be Greg's last drink. He would have many more. Ricky did not want to die tonight. He wanted to have a nice time at his final dance. He said no again and Greg and Jeff left the house. The dance was great and Ricky had a blast! He was so glad his dad had brought him. Greg and Jeff never made it to the dance. He had a car accident on the way there. He lost control of the car and it slipped off the highway. They are lucky Greg only broke his arm. Both boys learned a lesson they will never forget and Ricky thanked his dad for not letting him in the car with a drunk driver. It's good Mr. Smith insisted that his son not to ride in the car with Greg. Activity 2: Draw a 'character web' of Ricky.

Complete Exercise 13 in the Workbook. Use the Grammar Focus box as a reference. An adjective is a word that describes a noun. It comes before the noun it describes. Jim and Sally were having problems with their stubborn daughter. intelligent adolescents usually have fewer problems than ones who don't want to listen. Remember that a clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb. Therefore, an adjective clause is a group of words that describes a noun. An adjective clause starts with a relative pronoun which describes the noun it follows, but it is not a question. Therefore, in the clause, the subject comes first and then the verb. The relative pronoun that begins an adjective clause must describe the noun it follows. 1- mbo is used to describe a person as a subject in the main sentence. 2- mom is used to describe a person as an object in the main sentence. 3- ubich is used to describe a thing in the main sentence. 4- that may be used to describe a common noun (person) or a thing. 5- nbere is used to describe a location of place in the main sentence. 6- when is used to describe a time in the main sentence. 7- mise is used to describe possession in the main sentence. 8- Teenagers whose parents really care for them usually get the best advice. An adjective clause comes directly after the noun it describes and before the main verb. The verb in the adjective clause must agree with its subject. Adolescents nbe try to rebel against their parents end up getting into situations they may not be able to get out of. A situation which challenges adolescents may be the best learning experience for them. It may describe a common noun as well as a proper noun. If it describes a proper noun, it is called an appositive. It is separated from it and the main verb with a comma. Dr. Jones, who is one of the best adolescent psybiatrists, tried to help Frank better communicate with his parents. e. Adjective clauses always start with relative pronouns except in expression of quantity like: two of the boys, some of her students, half of the summer. I have three sisters, turo of whom are blond.

The most familiar ones are those that take place without warning and bring about catastrophic effects. Both earthquakes and the eruption of volcanoes, occur on the crustal plate boundaries and are consequently characteristic of certain areas in the world. Climatic bazares indude various storms, floods, or droughts. Tropical hurricanes are the worst and most widespread natural bazard. A British author, Gilbert Adair, described these bazards in London Sunday Correspondent Magazine (24 Dec.1989) He said that the earth is mankind's ultimate haven.

Do seasons change the occurrence of earthquakes? How many earthquakes occur cach year? Has there been an increase in worldwide earthquake activity in recent years? Has modern technology added any significant improvement to seismology ? h. Are all earthquakes the same ? 192 > EARTHQUAKES < 7. It is the vibrations produced in the Earth's crust when forces pushing on a mass of rock overcome the friction holding it in place, meaning that blocks of rock slip against cach other. The Earth's outer layer, called the crust, is divided into huge pieces called plates. These plates, which are made of rock, are constantly moving in different directions: away from each other, toward each other, or past each other. A crack in the Earth's crust between two plates is called a fault. Many earthquakes occur along faults where two plates collide as they move toward each other or grind together as they move past each other. Epicenter Fault Focus Wave fronts\" The vibrations range from barely noticeable to catastrophically destructive. Earthquakes generate shock waves that travel through the earth and are recorded at geophysical research stations. There are thousands of earthquakes each year, but most of them are too small to be felt. About 1 in 5 can be felt, and about 1 in 500 causes damage to property and loss of lives. Seismologists have devised two scales of measurement to describe the strength of earthquakes. One is the Richter scale, which measures the energy released at the focus of a quake. It is a logarithmic scale that runs from 1 to 9; each number represents a magnitude of quake 10 times more powerful than the preceding number. The Mercalli scale measures the intensity of shaking with gradations from I to XII. Intensity I on this scale is defined as an event felt by very few people, whereas intensity XII is a catastrophic event. Quakes of intensities II to III are roughly equivalent to quakes of magnitude 3 to 4 on the Richter scale, and XI to XII are about 8 to 9. There seems to be no relationship between earthquake activity and weather phenomena such as time of day, temperature or season of the year. Smaller earthquakes follow the largest earthquake of a series. They are usually concentrated in a restricted crustal volume. They differ from foreshocks that commonly precede a larger earthquake. It is not possible for scientists to tell when an earthquakes is going to occur now, and it may never be possible. Some people believe that animals and psychics can predict carthquakes, but that has not been proven. . The following chart of different earthquakes recorded on Richter scale will give you a clear idea. Descriptor Magnitude Average Annually Great 8 and higher 1 Major 7 - 7.9 18 Strong 6 . 6.9 120 Moderate 5 -5.9 800 Light 4 - 4.9 6,200 (estimated) Minor 3 - 3.9 49,000 (estimated) Very Minor < 3.0 Magnitude 2 - 3: about 1,000 per day Magnitude 1 - 2: about 8.000 per day 9. We continue to hear from many people throughout the world that earthquakes are on the increase. Although it may seem that we are having more earthquakes, those of magnitude 7.0 or greater have remained fairly constant throughout this century. Year Great Earthquake Major Earthquake 1985 1 13 1986 1 05 1987 0 11 1988 0 08 1989 1 06 1990 0 12 1991 0 11 1992 0 23 1993 1 15 1994 2 13 1995 3 22 1996 1 21 1997 0 20 194 In fact, in the last twenty years, we have had an increase in the number of earthquakes. This is because of the tremendous increase in the number of seismograph stations in the world and the many improvements in global communications, In 1931, there were about 350 stations operating in the world; today, there are more that 4,000 stations. Morcover, the data now comes in rapidly from these stations by telex, computer and satellite. This increase in the number of stations and the more timely receipt of data has allowed us and other seismological centers to locate rapidly many small earthquakes which were undetected in earlier years.

Every once in a while, hot melted rock A or molten rock, called magna, and other material from inside the carth may blast out, or erupt, through the opening on top of a volcano, called the crater. When the magna reaches the C air, it is called lava. Most red-hot lavas B emerge from a volcano at a temperature between 900 and 1200o D C. The lava rises in the vent and finally flows rapidly over the rim of the crater or through a fissure in the side of the conc. Gases and ashes continuously E escape from the lava's surface and may rise many kilometers. Deep down below the Earth's crust is a layer called the mantle, where most of the magna comes from. This layer is like a giant cauldron, fired by the hear deep inside the Earth. The effects of volcanoes can often be felt around the world. Scientists are becoming more successful in predicting when volcanoes will erupt, but eruptions still cause huge problems. Some problems come from the material that volcanoes throws out called ejecta, which includes gases, cinders, lavas, ashes, and muds. 200 3- Near an erupting volcano, thousand of lives may be lost and extensive damage may be done. In 1883, the cruption of Krakatau in Indonesia caused huge sea waves to wash across nearby islands, drowning 36,000 people. Mud, lava flows, and flooding caused by volcanic eruption have destroyed whole towns. In 1815, the cruption of the volcano Tambora in Indonesia not only killed 12,000 people in the area but caused worldwide climate changes. Most of the ejecta was ash that went into the sky and prevented some sunlight from reaching the earth. The climate of the whole world in the summer of 1816 was severely changed, and 1816 was called the year of no summer. As far away as the United States, large snowstorms hit New England in late June, and heavy frost occurred in July. Not all of the after-effects of volcanoes are bad. After a volcano has finished crupting and become dormant, plants begin to grow again and the result is a beautiful mountain area. Many such mountain areas have become centers for recreation and tourism. In addition, the ejecta from volcanoes may benefit agriculture because it adds valuable minerals to the soil. Soil in the northwest section of the United States owes much of its fertility to the ejecta from the eruptions of Mount Saint Helens. Rock formed by lava can be used for building. The overflow of ashes from a volcano can preserve the ruins of man-made towns, thus providing a realistic picture of ancient civilizations. In AD 79, a heated mud and ash flow from Vesuvius, a 4,190-ft volcano overlooking Naples Bay in Italy, swept down the mountain, engulfing the city of Pompeii and its surroundings with debris more than 60 ft deep. For many centuries, Pompeii lay undisturbed beneath volcanic ashes and cinders, until 1748 when German archaeologist Johann Joachim Winckelmann began excavations. Many public structures and private dwellings were well-preserved. In addition, remains of some victims of the disaster were found in the ruins.

Activity 2: Read the first part of The Dog of Pompeii. When you reach a question box , answer the question before you continue reading. The Dog of Pompeii 4 By Louis Untermeyer Part I 1- Tito and his dog Bimbo lived (if you could call it living) under the wall where it joined the inner gate. They really didn't live there; they just slept there. They lived anywhere in Pompeii. Pompeii was one of the gayest of the Roman towns. The streets were always lively with shining chariots and bright red trappings; the open-air theaters rocked with laughing crowds; athletic sports were free in the great stadium; the Caesar visited the pleasure city once a year, and the fireworks lasted for days; and the sacrifice in the Forum were better than a show. But Tito saw none of these things. He was blind - had been blind from birth. No one could say how old he was, no one remembered his parents, no one could tell where he came from. As long as people could remember secing Tito - about twelve or thirteen years ago - they had seen Bimbo. Bimbo had never left his side. He was not only dog, but nurse, pillow, playmate, mother and father, too. 203 3- Did I say Bimbo never left his master ? (Perhaps I had better say comrade, for if anyone was the master, it was Bimbo.) Bimbo did trust Tito alone exactly three times a day. It was a fixed routine, a custom understood between boy and dog since the beginning of their friendship. Early in the morning, shortly after dawn, while Tito was still dreaming, Bimbo would disappear ... . Why do you think Bimbo would disappear ? When Tito awoke, Bimbo would be sitting quietly at his side, and a fresh-baked bread at his feet. At noon, no matter where they happened to be, Bimbo would put his paw on Tito's knee. The two of them would return to the inner gate. Tito would curl up in the corner and go to sleep, while Bimbo would disappear again. In half an hour he'd be back with their lunch. Sometimes it would be a piece of fruit or a scrap of meat, often it was nothing but a dry crust. But sometimes there would be one of those flat rich cakes, sprinkled with raisins and sugar, that Tito liked so much. At suppertime, the same thing happened. 5- Food was always there. Tito never asked where it came from, and Bimbo never told him. There was plenty of everything in Pompeii. So there was no danger of going hungry or thirsty - especially if you knew where to find it, and if you had a dog like Bimbo. 6- Tito was not the merriest boy in Pompeii. He could not romp with the other youngsters. But that did not make him sorry for himself. If he could not see the sights that delighted the lads of Pompeii, he could hear and smell things they never noticed. He could really see more with his ears and nose than they could with their eyes. When he and Bimbo went out walking, he knew just where they were going and exactly what was happening. What similar qualities are there between Tito and Bimbo ? \"Ah,\" he'd sniff and say, as they passed a handsome villa, \"They're giving a grand dinner tonight.\" And Bimbo would note that this would be a good place to visit tomorrow. Or as they neared the Forum, \"Mm-m! What good things they have today?\" \"Dates from Africa, new honey, and sweet onions. Come, let's see what they have in the Forum.\" And Bimbo, just as curious as his comrade, hurried on. Being a dog, he trusted his ears and nose (like Tito) more than his eyes. And so the two of them entered the center of Pompeii. The Forum was the part of the town to which everybody came at least once during the day. It was the General Square, and everything happened here. There were no public houses, but only public buildings; and the buildings look as if they were new - which, in a sense, they were. Why do you think the buildings were new ? The earthquake of twelve years ago had brought down all the old structures. Tito had heard a great deal about the earthquake, though being about a year old at the time, he could scarcely remember it. It had been a light onc. The weaker houses had been shaken down, parts of the wall had been wrecked, but there was little loss of life, and the brilliant new Pompeii had taken the place of the old. What according to the people of Pompeii were the causes of the earthquake No one knew what caused these earthquakes. Records showed they had happened since the beginning of time. Sailors said that it was to teach the city lazy folk a lesson and make them appreciate those who risked the dangers of the sea to bring them luxuries and protect their towns from invaders. The priests said that gods took this way of showing their anger to those who refused to worship properly. Everyone had different explanation, and everyone's explanation was louder than his neighbor's. They were talking about it this afternoon as Tito and Bimbo came out of the side street into the public square. \"I tell you,\" rumbled a voice which Tito recognized as bath master Rufus, \"There won't be another earthquake in my lifetime or yours because earthquakes, like lightnings, never strike twice in the same place.\" 12- \"Do they not ?\" asked a thin voice Tito had never heard before and knew it as the accent of a stranger. \"How about the two towns of Sicily that have been ruined three times within fifteen years by the eruptions of Mount Etna ? And does that column of smoke above Vesuvius mean nothing?\" What answer would you expect for that question ? We use it for our weather guide. When the smoke stands up straight, we know we'll have fair weather; when it flattens out, it's sure to be foggy; when it drifts to the east ... \" 14- \"Yes, yes,\" cut in the strange voice. \"I've heard about your mountain barometer. But the column of smoke seems hundreds of feet higher than usual and it's thickening and spreading like a shadowy tree. They say in Naples ... \" Tito knew this voice very well. It was Attilo, the jeweler. \"They talk while we suffer. Little help we got from them last time. Naples commits the crime and Pompeii pays the price. It's become a proverb with us. Let them mind their own business.\" 16- \"Very well my confident friend,\" responded the stranger, \"We also have a proverb _ and it is this: Those who will not listen to men must be taught by the gods. But I leave a last warning. When the smoke tree above Vesuvius grows to the shape of an umbrella pine, look to your lives.\" He drew his toga about him and walked away. \"Now what,\" said Atillo, \"did he mean by that ?\" By nightfall the argument had been forgotten. If the smoke had increased, no one saw it in the dark. Besides, it was Caesar's birthday, and the town was in holiday mood. Tito and Bimbo were among the merrymakers. Glossary Chariot (n) : horse-drawn, two-wheeled cart Trapping (n) : a light two-wheeled carriage Rock (v) : to move back and forth or from side to side Caesar (n) : a Roman emperor Luxury (n) : something expensive or hard to obtain Worship (n) : a religious practice in which love to God is expressed Barometer (n) : an instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure, used in weather forecasting Merrymaker (n) : one who participates in festive activities 206 Activity 3: Reread the first part of the story and determine the referent to the pronoun used in the story.

(Due in Lesson 4.) 207 LEGION In Activity 1: Predict what will happen to Tito and Bimbo. Read Part II of the story and check your prediction. The Dog of Pompeii Part II 19- Tito woke carly. Or, rather, he was pulled awake. Bimbo was doing the pulling. The dog had dragged Tito to his feet and was urging the boy along. Where, Tito did not know. He was still half asleep. For a while he noticed nothing except that it was hard to breathe. The air was hot and heavy. It seemed the air had turned to powder - a warm powder that stung his nostrils and burned his sightless eyes. 20- Then he began to hear sounds, peculiar sounds, like animals under the Earth. There was no doubt of it. The noises came from underneath. He not only heard them - he could feel them. As Bimbo half pulled, half coaxed him across, the ground jerked away from his feet, and he was thrown against a stone fountain. The water splashing in his face revived him. He got to his feet. Bimbo steadying him, helping him on. The noises grew louder; they came closer. But now they came from human throats. A few people, quicker of foot and more hurried by fear, began to rush by. A family or two - then a section - then, it seemed an army lost in a nightmare. First a sharp cracking, then a roar, then an explosion that tore earth and sky. Lightnings above were answered by thunders beneath. A house fell, then another. The two companions had escaped the dangerous side streets and were in a more open space. Tito had no idea of the time of day. Something inside - perhaps the lack of breakfast and lunch - told him it was past noon. He was getting too drowsy to walk. And Bimbo knew it too. The ground of the Forum was safe no longer. It was beginning to rock, then to pitch, and then to split. The earth wriggled like a caught snake, and all the columns came down. To walk was not enough now. Tito was too frightened to know what to do or where to go. He had lost all sense of direction. He started to go back to the inner gate; but Bimbo almost pulled his clothes from him. What did the creature want ? Bimbo was telling him the way out: the sea gate, of course, and then the sea. Bimbo guided Tito across open pits away from buildings that had caught fire and were dropping their burning beams. Tito could no longer tell whether the noises were made by the shrieking sky of the agonized people. It was growing harder to breathe. It was all dust now - dust and pebbles as large as beans: stones from the black heart of Vesuvius as if the mountain was turning itself out. Tito could not go on. The red-hot ashes blistered his skin, the stinging vapors tore his throat. He staggered toward the side of the road and fell. In a moment, Bimbo was beside him. But there was no answer. He licked Tito's hands, his feet, his face. The boy did not stir. Then Bimbo did the last thing he could - the last thing he wanted to do. He bit his comrade, bit him deep in the arm. With a cry of pain, Tito jumped to his feet. Tito was in despair, but Bimbo was determined. He drove the boy on, snapping at his heels. Sick with hunger, half dead with fear and fumes. Tito pounded on, pursued by Bimbo. How long he never knew. At last, he staggered through the marine gate and felt soft sand under him. 26- Someone was dashing sea water over him. Someone was carrying him toward a boat. Scientists were restoring the ancient city: excavators were working their way through the stores and trash that had buried the entire town. Much had already been brought to light - statues, household articles, even delicate paintings had been preserved by the fall of ashes that had taken over thousands of lives. Columns were dug up, and the Forum was beginning to emerge. It was at a place where the ruins lay deeper that the Director paused. \"Come here,\" he called to his assistant. \"I think we've discovered the remains of a building in good shape. Here is a whole wall standing with shelves inside it. It must have been a bakery. And here's a curious thing. What do you think I found under this heap where the ashes were thickest? The skeleton of a dog!\" 29- \"Amazing!\" gasped his assistant. \"You'd think a dog would have had sense enough to run away at that time. And what is that flat thing he's holding between his teeth? It can't be a bone.\" It must have come from this bakery. You know it looks to me like some sort of cake hardened with the years. And, bless me, if those little black pebbles aren't raisins. A raisin cake almost two thousand years old! I wonder what made him want it at such moment?\" Adapted from: The Dog of Pompeii by Louis Untermeyer (1932) 209 Glossary Nostrils (n) : the external openings of the nose Drowsy (adj) : dull with sleepiness, sleepy Shrieking (adj) : making a shrill and frantic cry Agonized (adj) : suffering extreme pain Determined (adj) : has reached a decision Excavator (n) : someone who uncovers remains by digging Activity 2: Dogs are known to be faithful to their owners. Is this the case with Bimbo ? Justify your answer with events from the story. Activity 3: What exactly happened to Bimbo? Write a narrative paragraph Recounting the incidents. Activity 4: Arrange the following events as they took place in the story. a. Tito started to go back to the inner gate, but Bimbo prevented him. b. Water from a fountain splashed in Tito's face and revived him. As soon as his feet touched the sand of the shore, Tito fainted. After escaping the dangerous side streets, Tito and Bimbo took a short rest at the Forum. A group of excavators discovered the skeleton of Bimbo. f. Bimbo died while trying to get a raisin cake for Tito. g. Bimbo bit Tito's arm. h. Tito was saved by some people sailing on a boat. Activity 5: The setting of a story is the time, place, and background in which the events take place. Study the setting of this story by answering the following questions. What specific words and phrases does the writer use in the story to help readers understand the setting? Why do you think the writer changes the setting in the last four paragraphs? Assignment : Rewrite the story of Tito and Bimbo by taking the following changes into consideration: . Setting: a modern town in the twentieth century. . Story Ending: a happy ending.

How can you tell ? What would the story lose were Tito a normal healthy boy ? How would you describe the situation in Pompeil before the eruption ? What explanations did the people of Pompeii give for the causes of natural disaster ? While reading the story, have you come across expressions or ideas that reflect any sense of humor? The sentences in Part II of the story are somehow shorter than those in part I _ compare, for example, Paragraphs 4 and 24. Is there any reason for that ? Activity 3: Part II of the story is rich in action verbs. Here's a list of most of them. Sort these verbs into two categories: actions caused by the volcano eruption and actions done by either Tito or Bimbo.

Find similar examples in the reading selection. Adverb Clauses When Tito went out walking. be knew just where be mas going Adverb clause (dependent) main clause (independent) When Tito went out walking is an adverb clause. It is a dependent clause because it cannot stand by itself. It must be combined with an independent clause: he knew just where he was going. An adverb clause can come in front of the main clause: -> Before Bimbo went to the bakery, he realized how hungry Tito had been. (A comma is used to separate the adverb clause from the main clause.) or after the main clause: > Bimbo realized how hungry Tito had been before he went to the bakery. (No comma is usually used to separate the adverb clause from the main clause, though in some cases, we use a comma.) or within the main clause: > Bimbo realized , before he went to the bakery, bow hungry Tite bad been. (Two comma are used to separate the adverb clause from the main clause.) Adverb clauses can be classified according to the relationship they have with the main clause. The following list contains major subordinating conjunctions which are used to express this relationship accordingly. Time when after till while once as soon as whenever before until as since by the time -> When Tito went out walking, he knew just where be was going. Tito knew exactly what was happening around bim.

Activity 3: Refer to Exercise 16 in the Workbook to read some of the questions asked during the interview. However, these questions are not placed in the correct order. Listen to the tape, and then write the number of the answer in front of each question. Activity 4: The following statements talk about hurricanes. Read them, and then listen to the tape again to find out which statement is mentioned in the listening text. The eye of a hurricane is usually 20-30 miles wide. 2- The dangers of a storm include torrential rains, high winds and storm surges. 3- A hurricane can last for 2 weeks or more over open water and can run a path inland extending for hundred of miles. 4- Typhoons and cyclones are other names for hurricanes. - Hurricanes can spawn tornadoes, which add to the destructiveness of the storm. 6- Floods generated by torrential rains also cause damage and loss of life. Following a hurricane, inland streams and rivers can flood and trigger landslides. 7- When a hurricane watch is issued, the best response is to protect your property by boarding up windows, bringing in outside items, and being prepared to evacuate the areas as soon as officials so advise. 8- Even more dangerous than the high winds of a hurricane is the storm surge The surge can devastate coastal communities as it sweeps ashore. The deadliest hurricane in U.S. history was the Galveston Island, Texas, storm of 1900. This storm claimed more than 6,000 deaths and is noted as the worst natural disaster in the country's history. The storm surge was 16 feet. The costliest hurricane recorded was Hurricane Andrew, August 1992. It was also the third strongest storm to hit the United States. It hit both the States of Florida and Louisiana. Estimates of damage are above $25 billion. Glossary Surge (n) : a heavy, billowing, or swelling motion like that of great waves Typhoon (n) a tropical cyclone occurring in the western Pacific or Indian oceans Cyclone-(n) : a violent, rotating windstorm Spawn (v) : produce Tornado (n) : a violent thunderstorm in western Africa or nearby Atlantic waters Torrential (adj) : resembling, flowing in, or forming torrents Hurricane watch (n) : a message from a local weather officer saying that a hurricane is expected to strike an area within the next two days Evacuate (v) : to withdraw from or empty a place or area, especially as a protective measure Devastate (v) : to lay waste; destroy 14 Activity 5: Study the grammar rules on beginning a sentence with a negative word.

Smaller earthquakes follow the largest earthquake of a series. They differ from foreshocks that commonly precede a larger earthquake. It is not possible for scientists to tell when an earthquakes is going to occur. Richter scale goes from 0 to more than 9.

Activity 3: Read the selection and answer the following questions. 1- Fascinated by language in daily life, I think a lot about the power of language-the way it can evoke a strong image, complex ideas, or simple truth. Lately, I have been giving a lot of thought to the kind of English that my mother speaks. I have even described it to people as \"broken\" or \"fractured\" English. I've also heard other terms being used, \"limited English\" for example. However, it seems that everything is limited including people's perceptions of the limited English speaker. 2- My mother has long realized the limitations of her English as well. she used to have me call people on the phone to pretend I was she. One time it was a call to her stockbroker in New York. She had just cashed out her small portfolio and it just happened that we were going to New York the next week, our first trip outside California. My mother was standing in the background whispering loudly about how mad she was that the stockbroker hadn't sent her check. And then I said in perfect English, \" This is Mrs. Tan, yes, I am getting rather concerned. You agreed to send the check two weeks ago, but it hasn't arrived.\" Then she began to talk more loudly in her \"broken\" English, threatening to tell his boss that he was cheating her. \"I can't tolerate any more excuses\" I continued. \"If I don't receive the check immediately. I am going to have to speak to your manager when I'm in New York next week.\" Sure enough, the next week there we were in front of the astonished stockbroker, and my mother, the real Mrs. Tan was shouting at his boss in her impeccable \"broken\" English. I have been thinking about all this lately, because I've been asked, as a writer, why there are not more Asian Americans represented in American literature. This makes me think that there are more Asian-American students whose English spoken in the home might also be considered \"broken\" or \"limited\". And perhaps they have teachers who are steering them away from writing. Fortunately, I happen to be rebellious in nature and enjoy the challenge of disproving assumptions made about me. I turned away my pre-med enrollment in favor of English Literature and became a writer. I later decided I should envision a reader, and it was my mother. In my writings, I wanted to capture what language ability tests can never of her thoughts. reveal: her intent, her passion, her imagery, the rhythms of her speech, and the nature Adapted from: Blanton, L. and Lee, L.

The Secrets of Marital Bliss < While some opposites may attract, researchers say they don't necessarily stick together for the long haul. Sometimes camouflaged in the dense lingo of academia are the plain facts we need to run our lives. What for instance, is the secret of a happy marriage? Not surprise gourmet meals, getaway weekends, or other nostrums dispensed in magazines. Rather, according to one researcher, the secrets of marital bliss resides simply in the notion: positive assortative mating. Translation: Marry someone like yourself. 2- Studies by researchers suggest that while some opposites may attract, they do not necessarily adhere. Indeed the glue that keeps people together is a common outlook on life. Such romantic reciprocity begins early. It has been long known, for instance, that people tend to choose mates who have similar physical traits, intellect, and temperament. The most stable partners, in other words, often have similar builds, read the same newspaper, and argue at the same decibel level. The tendency to seek mirror images does not stop at marriage; we also choose friends who are like us. 3- Why are we drawn to our own approximations? \"What we seek out are environments where we can feel comfortable to express who we are,\" researchers say. Similarities set off sparks because lonely people \"seek out a guarantee that there is basis for interaction.\" 4- Sameness has even more profound effects in relationships. Spouses who remain fairly similar in values and attitudes are more likely to stay together after 20 years; those who disagree are more likely to split up. However, long time mates do not turn into clones of each other. But, according to researchers, they tend to change in the same direction. Whichever direction they take, they usually proceed in tandem. The cause of these parallel changes is not due to one's influence on the other. Rather, it is shared experiences. These shared experiences in turn strengthen the relationship. Similar partners choose each other and pursue similar directions. This causes them to share experiences and thus sustain their similarities. Some researchers disagree and say that it is not similarities that helps people stay together, but rather being able to handle differences. \"They need to have the same style of dealing with conflict,\" they say. Still all researchers contend that a union of opposites is not necessarily a match made in heaven. 7- Finally, expressed in a more academic context, researchers say; \"Spouse similarity co- varies with relationship satisfaction.\" Translation: Don't fall in love with a cowboy if horses make you sneeze.

Come and have a drink of water.\" Again the young man protested that his father would be upset. Losing his patience, the clergyman said, \"Your father must be a real slave driver.

Activity 3: Read the title of the text, and then, write what you already know about Dinning Etiquette in the column marked (K), and what you want to learn from this selection in the column marked (W) of Exercise 12 in the Workbook. Dining Etiquette Table manners play an important role in making a favorable impression. They are visible signals of the state of our manners and behavior and therefore are essential to professional success. Napkin Use The meal begins when the host unfolds his or her napkin. This is the guest's signal to do the same. Place your napkin on your lap, completely unfolded if it is a small luncheon napkin or in half, lengthwise, if it is a large dinner napkin. The napkin remains on your lap throughout the entire meal and should be used gently to blot your mouth. If you need to leave table during the mcal, place your napkin on your chair. Once the meal is over, you should follow the host's lead and place your napkin on the table to the right of your dinner plate. Ordering If, after looking over the menu, there are items you are uncertain about, ask your server any questions you may have. Answering your questions is part of the server's job. It is better to find out before you order that a dish is prepared with something you do not like or are allergic to than to spend the entire meal picking tentatively at your food. A host will generally suggest that your order be taken first; his or her will be taken last. As a guest, you should not order one of the most expensive items on the menu or more than two courses unless the host indicates that it is all right. If the host says, \"I'm going to try this delicious sounding cheesecake; why don't you try dessert too,\" or \"The prime rib is the specialty here; I think you'd enjoy it,\" then it is all right to order that item if you would like. Use of silverware Choosing the correct silverware from the variety in front of you is not as difficult as it may appear. Start with the knife, fork, or spoon that is farthest from you and work your way in. If you remember this rule you'll do fine. There are two ways to use a knife and a fork to eat your food. In the American style, one cuts the food by holding the knife in the right hand and the fork in the left hand with the fork tines holding the food to the plate. Then, lay your knife across the top edge of your plate with the sharp edge facing in, and move the fork to your right hand to eat. In the European style, one cuts the food in the same manner as in the American way, but the fork stays in the left hand. Simply eat the cut pieces by picking them with your fork still in your left hand. When you are finished Do not push your plate away when you are finished cating. The common way to show that you are finished with your meal is to lay your knife and fork side by side, diagonally across your plate. Place your fork tines down and the serrated edge of your knife inward. Make sure they are placed in such a way that they do not slide off the plate as it is being moved. Once you have used a piece of silverware, never place it back on the table. Do not leave a used spoon in a cup, either; place it on the saucer. You can leave a soup spoon in a soup plate. Leave any unused silverware on the table. O Activity 4: Work with a partner to complete Exercise 13 in the Workbook.

OActivity 3: Read the following selection to learn about the unique behavior around the dinner table in Japan, and to see if your predictions are correct, then fill the Learned (L) column of Exercise 16 in the Workbook. > Eastern Dining: Unique Dinner Etiquette of Japan < Japanese dishes are served either on the table for all the dinner's company present or separately for each guest, set on a small, square meal-tray. Other notable dinner etiquette during a Japanese meal are the following: - The lid of the rice bowl is placed upside down outside of the tray to the left. Soon afterward, the lid of the soup-bowl should be placed on the guest's right. When eating politely, it is proper to put the bowl of food on the left palm. A second helping of rice or soup may be served on a separate tray by the host. The guests must warmly accept the bowl with both hands, taking care to put it down on their trays once before beginning to eat from it again. 230 - A morsel from a dish should be followed by a mouthful of rice. - As a rule, no napkins are used in a Japanese meal. The guest uses either a paper or a handkerchief that he has with him. - At the end of the meal, the tips of the chopsticks are dipped in tea poured into the empty rice-bowl and then wiped off on a clean piece of paper. All the lids are replaced. - The guest says, \"Godbisoosamd\" with a bow. This concludes the dinner at a Japanese house. Manipulation of Chopsticks in Japan Chopsticks should be placed on the table pointing to the diner's left, with the tips resting on the \"bashiok/\". Take the chopsticks in your right hand and transfer them to the left hand. Then take the proper grip on them with the fingers of the right hand. - Do not use your chopsticks to shift dishes around. - Do not wave your chopsticks about in the air while trying to decide what to cat next. - Do not pick up a dish with the hand that is holding the chopsticks. - Do not point your chopsticks at people when you are eating; never lick them or spear food with the points. - Do not hold the chopsticks with your fist, since this appears as if they are being held as a weapon to hurt people. Also, put the chopsticks on the chopstick rest when not in use. This offers a convenient position to rest you cating utensils without worrying about unclean surfaces making contact with the points. Generally available at the more expensive or classier dinning rooms.

Mending Wall By Robert Frost Something there is that doesn't love a wall. That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, And spills the upper boulder in the sun; And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. The work of hunters is another thing: I have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone, But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, No one has seen them made or heard them made, But at spring mending-time we find them there. I let my neighbor know beyond the hill: And on a day we meet to walk the line And set the wall between us once again. We keep the wall between us as we go. To each the boulders that have fallen to each. And some are loaves and some are nearly balls 233 We have to use a spell to make them balance: \"Stay where you are until our backs are turned!\" WE wear our fingers rough with handling them. Oh, just another kind of out-door game, One on a side. It comes to little more: There where it is we do not need the wall: He is all pine and I am apple orchard. My apple trees will never get across And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him He only says, \"Good fences make good neighbors.\" Activity 4: Answer the following questions.

Should people be responsible for their behavior? 2. Should people blame fate for their mishaps? How do you know that your behavior is bad or good? Who do you go to when you face a problem? Activity 3: Free write for five minutes about what you consider to be a bad behavior? Activity 4: Read the selection to find answers to your discussion questions? In this selection, the narrator is a therapist that counsels people about their bad habits and behavior. She has a radio talk show, and people call in to ask her for advice. Other people write her letters and she answers them over the radio. 1- Years ago, people would tell me about their problems coping with life, I'd rather consider the unconscious motivations for their behavior. I was bothered by the notion that a bad experience in the past is the cause of a person's present problems. I also worry about just how much blaming something in the past keeps people stuck and feeling like victims. 2- \"Considering my hurts, disappointments and traumas, I can't be responsible for the havoc I wreak in the lives of others of the mess I've made of my own life.\" Puhleese, she replies, as if she does not want to believe him. 3- Does anyone really believe those people that come from good families and ideal social conditions can-and-will-behave with character, courage and conscience? Does anyone really believe that laziness and gutlessness are products only of some form of psychoneurosis? Call me a heretic, but I believe that even with bad stuff in your past, you have choices. Of course, the typical rejoinder is \"How dare you blame the victim for his unhappiness?\" asks Tom. But there is a big difference between blaming the victim and trying to get across the fact that it is within his power to gather courage and move on. After listening to people's stories for almost two decades, I have concluded that the path to healthy relationships and self-respect starts with the decision to do the right thing. Beth, wrote to me about her childhood, her parents' divorce when she was six, and about the poverty that had kept her from going to college. \"Under these conditions I could have become a victim,\" she concluded. \"But I chose to change my circumstances through hard work and perseverance. 6- \"While some of my decisions were indirectly related to what happened in my childhood, I am still responsible for the choices I made. Once we decide to make the best of what ever our situation is, we will be better people, and the world will be a better place in which to live.\" Acknowledging that you are responsible for messing up your own life is admittedly very upsetting. But it is that very acknowledgement that gives you the power to change things. Sometimes life seems a slalom, an obstacle course, even a bad joke with you as the subject. I don't believe for a minute that everything that happens to you is your doing or your fault. But I do believe the ultimate quality of your life and your happiness is determined by your courageous and ethical choices, and by your overall attitude. You may get shipped some bad bricks and weak steel, but you are still the general contractor. What do you want to do? Or wait for better parts?

No napkins are used in a Japanese meal. The tips of the chopsticks are dipped in tea poured into the empty rice-bowl and then wiped off on a clean piece of paper. The guest says, \"Godbisoosamd\" with a bow. Mending Wall By Robert Frost is a poem about mending a wall. Read the title of this poem and predict what it is about. Discuss the narrator's attitude toward the wall in two groups: A and B. Share your ideas and agreements, and sort out your disagreements about the two men's attitudes. Use these questions to help you understand your own behavior. How do you know that your behavior is bad or good? Who do you go to when you face a problem? Activity 3: Free write for five minutes about what you consider to be a bad behavior. Happiness is determined by your courageous and ethical choices, and by your overall attitude. You may get shipped some bad bricks and weak steel, but you are still the general contractor. What do you want to do? Or wait for better parts? As a listener named Christina wrote, \"The more time we spend blaming our circumstances on others, the moreTime we waste\""}

Definitions and Properties Two triangles are said to be similar when two angles of one are e two angles of the other. The angles of two similar triangles If two triangles have two angles of one equal to two angles of the other, then the third angles are also equal since the sum of the ang of a triangle is 180. We have: PROPERTY 1 In two similar triangles, the three angles are respectively equal. The sides of two similar triangles In two similar triangles, the sides opposite equal angles are called corresponding sides (homologous sides). In the adjacent figure, triangles ABC B and DEF are similar. The two triangles AKL and DEF are congruent by S.A.S. On the other hand, the corresponding D angles AKL and ABC are equal, so the lines (KL) and (BC) are parallel. Consequently, the two triangles ABC and DEF have their sides respectively proportional. Hence the following property: PROPERTY 2 In two similar triangles, the corresponding sides are respectivel proportional.

When you look at a pencil immersed partially and obliquely in a cup of water, the pencil seems broken, Also the water fountains of the above figure are illuminated. At sunset, the Sun (a spherical star) seems oval-shaped. All these observations as well as many similar others show evidence of the phenomenon of refraction of light. Define the index of refraction of a transparent medium Represent by a diagram the deviation of a luminous ray when it passes from air to water or to glass and when it passes from water to air or from glass to air. Optics 11 1 Refraction of light The passage of light from one transparent medium into another transparent medium is, generally, accompanied by a sudden change in its direction of propagation. Such passage is called refraction. How can we show evidence of this phenomenon? Activity 1: Change in the direction of propagation of light. Send a narrow beam of light(called luminous ray) obliquely on one of the faces of a glass plate of parallel faces (Fig.1). Light crosses the plate and emerges from the other face Did the direction of propagation of light change upon crossing the surface of the air-glass separation? Did light travel along a straight line inside of the glass plate? Did the direction of propagation of light change upon passing from glass to air? What phenomenon takes place when light crosses each surface of separation? Do the changes in the direction of light on the two surfaces take place in the same direction or in opposite directions? Activity 2: Path of light from air to glass. Send on the plane face of the semi- A part of this ray is refracted along IP and the other part is reflected along IR. refracted ray IP with the normal N'IN ? Would you obtain always a refracted ray?

When incident light in air falls on the surface of any transparent medium, it crosses and refraction takes place. However, sometimes and under certain conditions, the ray does not refract into the other medium, it remains in the same medium and undergoes total reflection on the surface of separation. Under what conditions would this phenomenon take place? Activity 4: Path of light from glass to air. Consider the same setup of activity 3, and draw the new normal N'IN. Send a luminous ray SI on the circular face of the semi-cylinder so that it passes through the center I of the disk. Two rays are formed: the refracted ray IP and the reflected ray IR (Fig. 6a). Is the refracted ray nearer to the normal than the incident ray or farther? What do we call the angle r formed between the reflected ray IR with the normal IN? Compare this angle with the angle it.

In this chapter you are going to learn how to construct the images of objects in converging and in diverging lenses, and also how to distinguish between real images and virtual images. Objective Distinguish between real image and virtual image. Optics 35 1 Images given by a converging lens. A- Image of a luminous point. When a luminous point A is put in front of a converging lens, it sends light in all directions in the form of luminous rays. When some of these rays fall on the lens, they cross it and may collect in a point A' that we call the image of A. What is the nature of A' and how do we construct it? Activity 1: The conjucate points A and A ar collinear with the optical center of the Formation of the image. Turn on the light of a small 6V lamp. Place the lamp in front of a converging lens (L) at a distance larger than its focal length f. Place a translucent screen (E) behind (L) perpendicular to its optical axis (. What do you see on the screen? Move the screen so that the spot of light on it has the smallest possible dimensions (Do you notice on the screen a shape similar to that of the filament? Does a point image A correspond to the extremity A of the filament? All rays issued from A pass through A after crossing the lens. A' is called the conjugate of A. Does a conjugate point correspond to each point of the filament? What do we call the set of these conjugate points? Does the position of this set depend on: - The position of the eye of the observer? The position of the lamp? - The position of the screen? What is the least number of emergent rays needed to construct the image A' of A? What incident rays would you choose? When the rays leaving the lens form a converging beam, which can collect at a point and hence can be collected on the A screen, the image is then real behind (L). When the emerging beam is diverging and A' F 0 F is obtained as the meeting point of the produced directions, the image is then virtual and cannot be collected on the screen, as emerging light seems to come out of it. Is the image A' of A given by (L) real or virtual? Draw now any two rays from A on (L). Al and AJ determine the boundaries of the luminous beam incident from A. Through what point do the rays leaving the lens pass? What are then the boundaries of the beam emerging from the lens? Activity 3: F Construction of the virtual image. 0 What incident rays would you choose? Is the image A' of A given by (L) real or virtual? Optics of a dimensional object We have seen that a converging lens gives, for a point object A, a single point image A. Does the converging lens give for a dimensional object a single image? Activity 4: Formation of the image Look for the image of the letter F b moving the translucent screen (E) that Cut the letter F in a black cardboard placed perpendicular to the optical axis o sheet (L) (Fig. 4). Fix this sheet using some plastisine Is the image received on (E): perpendicularly on a table or on an optical - real or virtual? The room being dark, illuminate the letter F with a lantern from behind (left). AB is perpendicular to the optical axis with A on that axis (Fig. 5). Is B' real or virtual? Drop the perpendicular from B' on the optical axis of (L). What does the foot of this perpendicular represent? How can you locate the position of A, the image of A? How can you find the emergent ray corresponding to any ray incident from B? From C? 38 Optics Unit C- Position and size of the image. In a movie theater, a real and magnified image is projected on the screen; through a magnifying glass, we see a virtual magnified image. In a camera, a real and small image is collected on the sensitive film. A lens gives, for an object, an image the position and nature of which vary according to certain conditions.

The eye\n\nKey Phrases: reduced eye optical, functioning eye object, parts reduced eye, reduced eye, represent reduced eye, images reduced eye, reduced eye diagram, functioning eye\n\nContent: The eye Chapter We see objects when light from these objects falls on the sensitive cells of our eye's retina. The eye is the organ of vision, it is the most perfect light receiver. It allows man to observe (thus know about) the world around him . The mechanisms by which the eye controls the amount of light admitted and adjusts itself to produce correctly focused images are far more complex and effective than those of the most sophisticated cameras. In this chapter you are going to study the principle of functioning of the eye and learn about the corrections of some of its defects. Objectives Represent the reduced eye by a diagram. Distinguish a normal eye from a myopic eye and a hyperopic eye. Optics 47 1 Reduced eye All optical instruments may be represented by diagrams showing the essential parts that affect the formation of images. The reduced eye is an example. What are the parts of the reduced eye? Activity 1: Some of the above mentioned parts m be represented by a lens that may collect Diagram of the eye light on the retina: .

Knowing that the distance lens-retina is fixed, how can the eye adjust itself to see clearly objects at different distances? Place a screen (E) perpendicular to a table and put (Li) at 20 cm from the screen (E). Place on the side opposite of (E) relative to the lens, a lighted candle very far from (LI) (Observe the screen. Do you see a clear image of the flame? Without modifying the positions of (Li) or (E), move the candle towards (L1) until it becomes at 20 cm from it (Does the image remain clear on the screen? Replace(Li) by the other lens (L2) L (Fig. 2c). Is the image now clear on the screen? What, do you think, must be done to obtain a clear image of an object found at different distance from the screen without changing the distance lens - screen? L L Optics 49 Activity 3: Accommodation In the very far object. The image is formed on the retina. The ciliary muscles are relaxed. Does the eye see the image of this object? Where is the image focus of the eye lens in this case? The object is moved nearer to the eye (Fig. 3b). Does the image of this object remain on the retina? The image would remain on the retina only if the shape of the eye lens changes, thus a contraction of the ciliary muscles changes the radil of curvature of the eye lens. The object is thus seen by the eye (Fig.3c). Does this contraction increase or decrease the the vergence of the eye lens when the A object comes nearer? Starting from a minimum distance, the eye would no longer be able to form the image on the retina if the object is moved nearer (Does the increase in the vergence of the eye lens attain thus a maximum value? A A 50 Optics Due to what is this maximum limit ? This variation in the vergence of the eye lens is due to a characteristic property of the eye, called accommodation. When the object is in the farthest position (provided it is seen clearly by the eye) it is then said to be at the maximum distance of distinct vision or at the punctum remotum (P.R.) (When the object is in the nearest position (provided it is seen clearly by the eye) it is said to be at the minimum distance of distinct vision or at the punctum proximum (P.P.)

In the reduced eye model, the different transparent mediums are represented by a converging lens of variable focal lengths found at a fixed distance from a screen (retina). To see clearly objects at different distances the eye modifies its vergence according to the considered position, we thus say that the eye accommodates. The range of distinct vision of any eye is between its P.P. and its P.R. The range of distinct vision of a normal eye extends to infinity. The myopic eye is more converging than the normal eye, its defect is corrected using a diverging lens.

Pull the spring balances apart (What is the magnitude of the force FAB exerted by spring balance (A) on spring balance (B)? What is the magnitude of the force FBA exerted by spring balance (B) on spring A balance (A)? Do the two forces have: - The same direction or opposite directions? The same magnitude or different magnitudes? When a solid is in equilibrium, the two forces Fi and F2 acting on this solid must have: The same line of action; - Opposite directions; The same magnitude. How can we show evidence of this condition of equilibrium? Activity 4: Showing Evidence of the Condition of Equilibrium Adjust the zero of the two spring balances. Take a light body (of negligible weight), a piece of polyester for example, connect this body by means of two strings to the two ends of the two spring balances. Pull the two spring balances until the strings are taut. The body is at rest (Fig. 4). . What forces Fi and F2 act on the light body?

Perform the experiment again by suspending successively different masses from the end of the spring. The spring elongates under the action o the body. 7 Scale: - 1 cm on the vertical corresponds 6 to 1 N 5 - 1 cm on the horizontal 4 corresponds to 0.02 m. 3 What is the shape of the obtained curve? Does the curve pass through the origin? What relation can be deduced between T and x and the force constant k (stiffness) of the spring? The constant of proportionality k between T and x is the stiffness of the spring (force constant). The constant k (stiffness) varies from one spring to another. Two identical springs have equal values of k. The curve giving the variations of T as a function of x is called the curve of elongation of the spring (Fig.8). 164 Mechanics When body A acts on body B by mechanical action chara by a force F AB, body B acts on A by a reaction characteriz force F BA.
